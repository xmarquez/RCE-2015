After a highly contended election in 1997, in which the most of the media had been forced to support the incumbent President Daniel arap Moi, and in which voter registration was so badly mismanaged that entire regions of the country were declared invalid, judicial reforms were announced to make the country operate more democratically. However, according to the 1999 Freedom House report, Moi repeatedly changed his position on accepting these reforms. Various reports by United States thinktank the Cato Institute discuss ethnic differences as a major cause of electoral inequality, which has contributed to the demands for reform in recent decades.",2,3,2,1,0,1,1,0,1,2,4,0,8,5,13

In 2010 Eritrea faced international condemnation for its poor treatment of human rights and accused of destabilizing the stability and security of the region. In 2009, Human Right Watch accused the PFDJ led government for turning the nation into 'giant prison 'and similarly in 2010 Amnesty International reported there were unlawful killings by security forces and also abuses, tortures were common practices for those military service deserters . And in 2010 Universal Periodic Review (UPR ) of human rights accused Eritrea of violating the convention of human rights against torture. At the end of 2010 though the situation in Eritrea on the basis of humanitarian situation was the same but Eritrea has got considerable amount of foreign aid and China was one of those countries which donated the most ( Human right 2010 ) . In 2010, according to US State Department office the rights of workers were not respected the government introduced forced labour and even under age children were forced to join the forced labour carried out in the name of National service In 1998, both Ethiopia and Eritrea entered in the bloody border war and as a result thousands of lives and millions estimated properties had been lost. Therefore, in August 2009, International Tribunal based on Hague ordered both countries would pay compensations for the damages caused in 1998-2000 and the sanction that imposed in2009 again tightened in 2010 as the regime kept continuing supporting the Somalia based Islamic terrorist group. A year before namely in August 2009, international tribunal in Hague ordered both Eritrea and Ethiopia would pay compensations for the damages for 1998- 2000 war. Political freedom. According to U.S Department of State ( 2010 ) the Eritrean government refrained 'freedom of speech, press, assembly, association and religion' . Citizens have refrained from freedom of movement and also foreign national, According FIDH 2010 ( a world movement for Human Rights) International humanitarian (NGO) staff members faced arbitrary arrests, denied services ( from getting fuels ) and the rejection of entry visa . And the report added that the there was no freedom of movement its staff were not allowed to travel without approval of the especially traveling outside Asmara (capital city ) . To cite one example, Internationa l Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was one of those agencies which faced severe restriction from carrying out its activities because since 2009 ICRC was trying to visit the areas where Ethiopian origin citizens and also prisoners of war imprisoned repeatedly asked the government to get access on october 2010 Freedom of movement, according to the UN special Rapporteur keettharuth ( 2014 ) the movement of citizens even those who are in national service have no chance of freely moving through the country because identification paper was required to pass every check points There was no freedom speak and journalists faced imprisonment. In 2010, according to Reporters without Borders (RSF), about twenty nine journalists who worked on the state owned media, were detained without any trail and their whereabouts were also unknown. Freedom of association has been violated since 1990s especially there is freedom of religion. No one is allowed to practice his/her religion while he or she services military services because practicing religion during national service is prohibited According to human rights watch ( 2010 ) religious minority, not members of the four registered religious organizations ( Orthodox, Catholic, Islam and Protestant ) faced abuses, tortures and arrests because the government does not acknowledge to freely exercise their faith. For example in 2008 and 2009 about twenty five Jehovah witness members have been arrested. Similarly, in December, 2008 members of the orthodox church arrested by the security forces and the patriarch of the orthodox church got arrested ( 2006 ) War with Djibouti In 2010, UN and African Union requested the Eritrean government to investigate cause of the conflict between Eritrea and Djibouti, however, the Eritrean government refused to cooperate. In the same year the Qatari government brokered both Eritrea and Djibouti and Eritrea withdrew its troops. In 2008, Eritrea attacked Djibouti, after denying allegation of militantly attacking Djibouti, in June 2010, Eritrea pulled its troops Corruption According to World Bank 'public power is exercised for personal gain 'and there are petty and grand form of corruption 'in Eritrea. In control of corruption Eritrea ( 2010 ) percentile rank 39 and scores -0.455980033. I can justify my above answers are right becasue I know the regime's political system that never allow to existence of any oppostion parties nor respect freedom of speech, freedom of association. Abitrary arrest is common for example I had been in prison from 2002 to 2006, my imprisoment was not asscoaited political case i was arrested becasue of I deserted from military service that remain open ended. Therefore there ttreamnent of human being when I was in prison ( makeshift ) was very poor even the food we had been given was not enought regardless its qaulity. Generally speaking not only based on findings but with the news I heard and read Eritrea is still under the leadership of military comanded by a single man. what happened in the 2010 namely Eritrea was acussed of violating human right and its defiance to withdraw troops from the Djibouti territory but later withdrew its troops from the disputed areas by the mediation Qatar reflect the true nature of the regime.

Freedom House says on their website that: 'The government undertook a series of political reforms after 1998, including the introduction of an independent electoral commission, a single-ballot voting system, public campaign financing, and a third vice presidential position in the legislature for the opposition leader.' (Freedom House, 2008) Accessed: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2008/burkina-faso#.VVrnbdOqqko Dispite this Freedom House go on to state that: 'International monitors concluded that the 2005 presidential election was generally free, although not entirely fair, due to Compaore's [Burkino Faso's presedent] of privileged access to state resources and the media.' (Freedom House, 2008) Also in 2007, for example, only 57% of the population voted according to Freedom House, if elections were truly free and fair it would seem logical that more people than that would be voting (Freedom House, 2007) . Accessed: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2007/burkina-faso#.VVrnztOqqko The New Encyclopedia of Africa states that: 'In the presidential election of November 2005 Compaore easily won a third term over a badly frag- mented opposition, garnering 80 percent of the vote.'

This suggests that one of the reasons why elections may not seem fair (one party gets the vast majority of the votes) is in fact because the opposition is extremely fractured and unable to coordinate together to pose a real threat to Compaore's government. Accordign to Freedom House in 2006 there were more than 100 opposition parties (Freedom House, 2006) .

According to the World Value's Survey, in the year 2007, 58.4% of participants in a survey said that they voted in recent parliament elections (World Values Survey, 2007) .

According to The Economist Intelligence Unit (2007) 'Blaise Compaoré, who has already held power for nearly 20 years. This is not because the CDP and Mr Compaoré are universally popular: in fact, there is widespread public dissatisfaction with current economic and social conditions. However, as in many other African states, the opposition has failed to capitalise on such discontent.' ( The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2007) Reference: Burkina faso politics: Blaise's trail.

( The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2009) Reference: Burkina faso politics: Disaffected leader calls for change. (2009) . () . New York: The Economist Intelligence Unit N.A., Incorporated. Also most other political parties were relatively small.

The justification for question 7. The Economist Intelligence Unit writes in 2008: 'The main challenge to the CDP's grip on power will come from the unions, which have threatened further strikes, and from disgruntled elements within the government. Whatever political realignments may result over the coming months, Mr Compaoré remains firmly in control and, despite the potential for further political and social unrest, the Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to remain in power over 2008-09.' (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2008) Reference: Burkina faso politics: Outlook - political and social discontent rises. (2008) . () . New York: The Economist Intelligence Unit N.A., Incorporated This suggests that organised political groups such as unions have the best chance of accessing political power.

New York: The Economist Intelligence Unit N.A., Incorporated In 2008, the Economist Intelligence Unit writes that a new anti-corruption authority has been installed: 'on June 9 th [2008] the government created a new anti-corruption authority, Autorité supérieure de contrôle de l'Etat (ASCE) . Henri Bruno Bessin, a doctor of law and former secretary-general of various government ministries, was appointed state controller-general and chief of the ASCE.

According to Transparency International, Burkina Faso in 2005 Ranked 70/158 countries on their corruption scale in 2013 they ranked 83/177 (Transparency International, 2005, 2013) .

I found it harder to find information on this question. According to the BBC, in the year 2000 Burkina Faso's constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election of one person. This came into effect in the 2005 elections. Although Compaore had already been president for 20 years he was legally entitled to two more terms in power. He would have to stand down in the 2015 election. However, he tried to amend the law in 2014 (so he could remain president) and was removed from power because of this (BBC, 2014) .

Ortega was elected president in 2006, but has since then been undermining the independance of the country's courts and opposition parties. Fraud helps pick up a few extra congressional seats. 5. Over 35,000 citizens were unable to vote, most likely citizens who the president knew wouldn't vote in his favor. 6. Having bought seats to gain the majority, there is not much chance for oppositional parties to gain power over him and his current regime. 7. This is unfortunately just an educated guess based on reading up about the regime. 8. The constitution calls for a free press but allows some censorship. The press has faced increased political and judicial harassment since 2007. 9. The rulers of the state are not subject to the rule of law. This is evident in the fraud involved in gaining seats, and the corruption involved in court systems. 10. As far as human rights go, there aren't many.

"Guinea-Bissau",2011,2015,"""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Although a small nation, with a population not exceeding 1.7 million, Guinea-Bissau has had a turbulent political history and is still one of Africa's most fragile nations. Not once since independence in 1974 has an elected President completed an entire 5 year term. [1] A cycle of political violence (characterised by frequent military interventions) and ineffective governance has left it one of the poorest nations in the world. [2] The country is also an international hub for the illicit drug trade, commonly used as a route for cocaine produced in South America to reach markets in Europe. [3] The classifications bellow relate to the period 2012-2015: a military coup took place in 2012 and civilian rule was restored in 2014. As far as political rights are concerned Guinea-Bissau performs somewhat strangely on our metric, with notable areas of strength which perhaps do not reflect the nation's reality. Elections are considered to be relatively free and fair and so it achieved a top score of three points. [4] It also allows universal suffrage to all those over 18 and voters'support often swings, so there is a high likelihood of the main opposition party gain power in an election. [5] Political power is achieved through political parties, but these are dominated by existing power groups, and the ability of ordinary citizens to access power is limited. The media is technically free, but journalists are discouraged (through poor pay, working conditions and harassment) from reporting on issues sensitive to the military regime. A strong performance in our first 3 criteria somewhat hides the reality of the situation however. In actual fact, power is strongly centralised in the role of the President and elected governments are often overthrown (although new elections are often called soon afterwards) . [6] Unfortunately, our metric does not provide any option to lower Guinea-Bissau's score as a result. The civil liberties section of our metric was more difficult to complete. In almost all criteria assessed Guinea-Bissau had at least some procedures or institutions in place to protect civil liberties, although none of these appeared to function well. [7] Most difficult to answer was question 13 regarding equal treatment: many strong protections for minority groups exist in law (such as the legal nature of same-sex relations) so a score of 2 was given, yet due to the inability of the judiciary to function (score of 0) these protections are unlikely to be upheld. It is clear that Guinea-Bissau is extremely corrupt, although following the wording of our definition is was difficult to classify it as such. In order to accurately gauge the reality of the situation in Guinea-Bissau, a score of C was awarded for corruption, although it could be scored higher on a technicality. Corruption in the country is not linked as much to the misuse of public resources as is it to the trafficking of drugs and other illicit activities. [8] Even presidents have been implicated in corruption scandals of this nature. Bibliography for Guinea-Bissau 'Guinea-Bissau.' Freedom House.

However, to support my answers, I used a book called 'A History of Modern Burma' as the primary source, which was written by Michael W. Charney. A History of Modern Burma was first published by Cambridge University Press in 2009. The book covered almost everything about the Burmese military regime since it took power by a coup in 1962. As the so-called democratic transition was led by the Burmese military junta in 2010, the political situation in Burma has changed a little bit than before.

"Cameroon",2001,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials""","Question 4 - Free and fair elections: I answered, 'There are elections for the executive and the legislature but there is a very low likelihood of government change via elections'. There are almost 300 political parties in Cameroon, but it is essentially a one party state; most of these parties are too fragmented to provide any real contest. The SDF is the largest opposition party and in the 2011 elections president Biya still claimed 78% of the votes. Biya also determines Cameroon's electoral calendar. Sources for this information were Freedom-house and, in a minor capacity, Wikipedia. Question 5 - Universal suffrage: I answered, 'The majority of people in this country are able to vote. However, there are minor restrictions because of things such as age or incarceration, etc.' According to the CIA 'World Factbook' anyone over the age of 20 may vote in Cameroon. However, I was close to selecting 'there is partial suffrage, but there are widespread and blanket restrictions on groups of people voting for reasons such as ethnicity, gender, religion or age' as, according to Freedom House, while on paper everyone over the age of 20 has the right to vote, the Baka people face discrimination in Cameroon and are not represented in either house of parliament or in the top levels of government. So it appears that there may be some under the table racial discrimination on terms of suffrage. Question 6 - Opposition: I answered, 'There is an opposition, however the system is constructed so that there is little potential for it to gain power.' The SDF forms Cameroons primary opposition but has never received more than 22% of the vote due to President Biya's manipulation of the system. According to Freedom House 'State patronage and Biya's control of high-level appointments help his CPDM retain its hold on power, as does de facto state control over the timing of the release of mandated public funding for campaigning political parties and the government's payment of village chiefs'salaries; voting recommendations by village chiefs are often still followed absolutely.' Question 7 -Access to political power: I couldn't find any information relating specifically to this question; however, based on other information sourced from Freedom House, I answered 'Many people have access to political power, with some exceptions', as there are almost 300 political parties in Cameroon, indicating a reasonable access to political power, but some ethnic minorities, such as the Baka, have no political representation. Wealth may also influence the access to political power in Cameroon, as bribery is commonplace, but I did not think that this was the most pertinent factor. Transparency International also scores Cameroon poorly in terms of voice and accountability; the extent to which a countries citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media. Question 8 -Media: I answered that there is 'No state censorship, but a degree of self-censorship may exist, or there is substantial government influence on what is reported.' I based this on information found on Freedom House as, while Cameroon's constitution guarantees freedom of speech and stopped prepublication censorship, this freedom of expression is not entirely genuine; an article of the charter allows officials to ban newspapers etc. based on claimed 'threats to public order', with defamation remaining a criminal offense. Freedom house provides several examples of this article being potentially abused and misused. I thought that while there is no state censorship officially, the article in question might lead to a degree of self-censorship, as individuals/organisations do not wish to be penalised or imprisoned. As such there is still government influence on what is reported. Transparency International ranks Cameroon 97 th out of 179 countries on its Press Freedom Index. Question 9 -Rule of law: I answered, 'The leaders of the state are not subject to the rule of law.' According to information found on Freedom House and Transparency International, Cameroon's police force and government are highly corrupt, with bribe-taking common; it was ranked 84/91 in Transparency International's 2001 Corruption Perceptions Index and 144/177 in 2013. Critics have also accused President Biya of removing several political rivals. Question 10 -Human rights: I answered, 'Partial rights exist, but there is still heavy suppression and monitoring.' According to Freedom House Cameroon scores a 6 out of 7 on both its freedom rating and for civil liberties, 7 is the worst possible score. So while some rights exist in Cameroon many are supressed, especially for minority groups; those suspected of homosexual activity are targeted and persecuted, and while the constitution grants men and women equal rights, traditional legal values often take precedence. Travel is largely unrestricted. Question 11 -Judiciary: According to Freedom House the judiciary is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the courts are weakened by political influence and corruption. On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being heavily influenced and 7 being entirely free, Transparency International scores Cameroon a 2.7. As such, I answered, 'The judiciary sometimes operated independently, but it susceptible to undue influence and corruption.' Questions 12 -Measures for regime accountability: I answered, 'There are no checks and balances on power, or independent bodies established to investigate misuse of power.' While President Biya introduced an anti corruption campaign, operation sparrowhawk, in 2006, the organisation seems to exist largely on paper; and when it doesn't it is being used to convict Biya's opponents rather than place checks on his government. Cameroon's electoral commission, Elections Cameroon or ELECAM, was also formed in 2006 but remains dominated by appointees with close ties to the ruling party. Cameroon also scores poorly for accountability on Transparency International. Questions 13 -Minority Groups: I answered, 'There are no effective rights or measures to empower or protect minority ethnic or cultural groups' I couldn't find any specific information relating to this questions, but based on other factors, such as the lack of representation of the Baka people and the prosecution and targeting of homosexuals, I decided that it was unlikely that there were rights or measures to empower or protect minority ethnic or cultural groups. Question 14 -Confidence in answers: On the scale of 1-5 I chose a 4. I am quite confident in my answers and their justifications; however, there were a couple of cases where I was tossing up between two answers and had to make an educated guess due to the lack of explicit information. Question 15 -Corruption: I answered, 'Corruption is pervasive from the head of government to low-level government workers.' Cameroon ranks 136 th out of 175 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, and scores 27 out of 100; where zero is the worst possible score. It also scores in the 17 th percentile for control of corruption, reflecting the lack of anti-corruption measures in place and the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain. Question 16 -Forms of corruption: I answered, 'Bribe-taking by public officials.' Freedom House cites bribery as commonplace and pervasive in all sectors in Cameroon; including anything from gaining school admissions to fixing traffic infractions. Cameroonians seeking to resettle abroad can allegedly base fraudulent asylum claims on purchased, and faked, police reports and medical records, and even on news articles alleging persecution that were written in exchange for bribes. According to Transparency Internationals Global Corruption Barometer for 2010/11, 54% of those surveyed in Cameroon reported having payed a bribe.",1,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,0,4,0,9,3,12
"Italy",1996,2001,"""Not much corruption detected""","I chose to focus on the period between 1996 and 2001 (between two general elections), because this period included four governmental changes, and four different Prime Ministers (Prodi, D'Alema, Amato, and Berlusconi) . My justifications for each of the RCE's questions are as follows: Due to the fact that both elections held in 1996 and 2001 resulted in new governments formed by different parties, I can deduce that the Italian election system was free and fair during this period. They were both competitive and transparent. The CIA World Factbook sates that Italy has universal suffrage, 'except in senatorial elections, where the minimum age is 25.' https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html . See Question 4 Justification. There is effective opposition, and they do have a chance to be elected to govern. I feel that all Italian adult citizens have fair access to political power. I consider the number of political parties on the 1996 and 2001 electoral list to be a sign of fair access in the Italian political system. The fact that leaders like Romano Prodi have come from middle-class families is also a positive sign of inclusion in the system. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/299254.stm . Berlusconi's ownership of much of Italy's media industry means that he has an incredible influence over the direction and context used by Italia media outlets. While he was in power he was able to shut-down any story going through his companies. While his reign has Prime Minister was before and after this period, he was still an active member of Parliament between 1996 and 2001. http://www.academia.edu/7393447/Censorship_and_media_ownership_in_Italy_in_the_Era_of_Berlusconi . I could not find any cases of politicians and leaders being able to dodge the law. Silvio Berlusconi is currently held on charges abuse of office and has been convicted of fraud. All of which are dated outside of this period. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/silvio-berlusconi/11455606/Silvio-Berlusconi-completes-community-service.html . Between 1998 and 2001, Freedom House ranks Italy favourably when it comes to civil liberties (2 out of 7) . Freedom to assemble and freedom of religion, among others are guaranteed by the constitution. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/1998/italy#.VV212vmqqko . In 2001, Freedom House called the Italian judiciary system, 'independent but notoriously slow and inefficient' . It also states that the post-Mussolini constitution sharply restricts the powers of the executive, in-favour of the legislative and judicial branches. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/italy#.VV23EPmqqkp . There are effective processes to hold the government accountable, and hold them liable for their actions. Romano Prodi was removed from power after a vote of no confidence by the parliament. As with Question Eleven, the Constitution gives the legislative the ability to question the executive. The independent court system has the power to prosecute leaders if the break the law. Difficult to answer. There are always cases of social discrimination. Northern League leader, Umberto Bossi, launched a xenophobic attack against gays, Muslims, and foreigners in 2000. This drew criticism from his political opponents and rights advocates, however did not lead to criminal charges. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/italy#.VV289_mqqko . Educated guess, no record of high level corruption in the studied period. However there were the Mani Pulite corruption scandals in the early 1990s, I am assuming that these could have possibly spilled over into this period. There were also accusations of corruption against Silvio Berlusconi during his governance both before and after this period. It would be hard to imagine that this did not continue through his time as a Minister of Parliament. http://italychronicles.com/italys-corruption-scandal-anniversary/ . Aside from the Mani Pulite scandal and accusations against Berlusconi, there were no significant cases of corruption that I could find. Because the charges for the scandal occurred before the period, I did not consider them for this question.",3,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,4,2,13,14,27
"Brazil",1995,2003,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Brazil's government under Fernando Henrique Cardoso (FHC) between 1995 and 2003 was one that saw major changes to the country's economic, social, and political framework. This was a president who began the process of tackling corruption, poverty, and the massive wealth gap. The sources used for this exercise include Freedom House reports, Transparency International, Forbes, Time Magazine, and local news reports from the time. Elections in Brazil appear to have been free and fair, especially during the 1998 election where FHC secured the largest winning margin in Brazilian history. Freedom House reports that the elections were free and fair with opposition parties gaining seats and winning several gubernatorial districts. This is backed up by transparency international reports who claim that since 1988 there have been strong electoral regulations surrounding campaigning and funding to political parties (Transparency International, 2013) . Brazil has some of the strongest laws surrounding campaigning and the electoral process. This has allowed me to give it a high score in the free and fair elections framework. Universal Suffrage also exists, however some isolated communities often find it difficult to get to election booths due to the remoteness of much of the interior of Brazil. Access to political power is very restricted to those who have either pre-existing connections with powerful individuals or large amounts of money. Often Oligarchs and business magnates become governors or politicians to further their own interests. Access to political parties is free and association is a guaranteed right under Brazillian law, however this does not always translate into political power as only those with the aforementioned connections or wealth have the means to become leaders. This restricts access to the baubles of office but does allow for political activism through political parties (Mello, 2013) . Freedom of expression and the freedom of media are two important aspects of Brazil that, during the FHC years, were improved on through congressional order. Anti-corruption measures in the police meant that opponents of the government were more able to openly criticize public offices without fear of retribution from the police. The media is privately owned and acts as a major critic of the government. This was apparent during FHC's term as president as he privatized the state telecommunications company Telebras. This opened access to the network for private media outlets who had no government affiliations (Epstein, 1998) . During FHC's presidency he also sought to engage with civil society for consultation on many of his landmark policies this was an unprecedented move from his predecessors who sought to act unilaterally excluding minority and civil society groups. FHC used his expertise in sociology and academia to engage with interest groups and gain favour with a broad spectrum of Brazilian society. Between 1995 and 2003 huge leaps were conducted in terms of human rights for indigenous minorities in Brazil. Marginalized groups of the interior had been ignored for too long by central government and FHC sought to establish reservations for them to guarantee them land and fundamental human rights (Amnesty International, 2014) . However, there is an underlying issue with the Brazilian judiciary. It has long been underfunded and 'local justice'prevails in many states. Between 1995 and 2003 no major advances in the Brazilian judicial system took place, it remains underfunded and powerless to be an effective check on the power of the legislature and executive (Freedom House, 1998) . Corruption in the police force has also undermined many efforts to try to alleviate some of the issues in the judiciary as the legitimacy of police actions is questionable, especially in the favelas of the large cities. This is why Brazil ranks poorly in the judicial and accountability indexes. Corruption at all levels has proven to be a formidable issue for Brazil to overcome and FHC tried to mitigate this through transparent campaigning and a focus on building trust with civil society. Leading by example did not have the desired flow on effects through the rest of central and local government with corruption still rife at almost all levels of government. Taskforces have been established by numerous presidents since FHC but due to the weakness of the judiciary have been unable to tackle widespread corruption. A certain degree of corruption is culturally accepted in Brazil due to its longevity and how it has become ingrained in society. So, it is not necessarily something that troubles society there, it just undermines the legitimacy of government institutions. This is why the corruption index is remarkably low for Brazil. Corruption is present in most forms, but primarily in the form of political patronage, where well connected officials receive benefits or policy concessions. Illicit commercial activities also continue to fund many governors of the interior and, although the campaign process is heavily regulated, funds are only disclosed after elections are held and this disclosure usually leads to no further investigation. So, during the FHC years Brazil made moves to become a freer country, with a more legitimate government and where the central government engaged with civil society to build trust and guarantee freedoms. Despite these intentions corruption and a weak judiciary have constantly undermined congressional moves to address such issues (Antunes, 2013) . References Amnesty International. (2014) .

"Algeria",1990,1998,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","After an independence in the 1960s, Algeria was ruled by President Houari Boumediene, who took over in a military coup in 1965. Boumediene ruled Algeria for the next decade, overseeing a massive programme of socialisation and industrialisation. His successor, Chadli Bendjedid, also introduced reforms. However, Algeria's economic dependency on oil revenue led to hardship when the price collapsed in the 1980s. Economic recessions, as well as widespread dissatisfaction with the regime caused widespread unrest that eventually saw Bendjedid introduce a multi-party system in Algeria (BBC, 2015) . This classification looks at Algeria from 1990, just after the new system was introduced, to 1998, after the election collapsed and Algeria spiralled into civil war. The first election in December 1991, according to a background paper by Cornell University, saw over 5,000 candidates compete for 231 seats in the country's parliament. The results of the first round saw the Islamic Salvation Front, which campaigned on a platform of Sharia law, win 188 seats -an outright majority. At a news conference soon after the election, Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali, said the first round had taken place 'generally in an atmosphere of calm and reassurance' and that independent sources had confirmed that elections were free and clean (Cornell, n.d.) . Suffrage was widespread, with Algeria a country generally regarded as reasonably liberal towards women, and unlike other countries in the region, equality wad enshrined in Algeria's laws and the constitution, which allowed them to vote and run for political positions. However, some societal norms restricted the freedom of women to vote, particularly in rural areas (Reuters, 2009 ) . After a promising election, things turned to custard for Algeria. In 1992, the Army cancelled the second round of the election because it feared an Islamic state. The military then took over and effectively instilled martial law in the country (Freedom House, 1998) . In 1993, Major General Lamine Zeroual was appointed President after Benjedid was forced from office. Algeria then descended into a bloody civil war between government forces and Islamist militant groups which, according to Freedom House, killed as many as 70,000 people. During the Civil War, strict laws were introduced to constrain public debate. Freedom of assembly was extremely limited except for those that supported the government, NGOs had to be licensed, and heavy-handed censorship was brought in to control the media. Journalists, particularly those who worked for state media became targets for Islamist militants, while State controls were also excessive -broadcast media and newspapers were threatened with closure, and editors and reporters were constantly arrested. All war reports had to be approved by government censors (Freedom House, 1998) . In 1997, the United Nations Human Rights Commission issued a report highly critical of the Algerian regime's human rights record. Human rights groups charged government forces with thousands of disappearances, torture, and other excesses against alleged militants and their suspected supporters (Freedom House, 1998) . After the 1991 election collapsed, democracy in Algeria was further eroded. In 1995, a presidential election drew a 75-percent turnout in a vote that was restricted to only regime-approved candidates that Freedom House said gave Zeroual limited legitimacy. A new constitution in 1996 banned Islamist parties and expanded presidential powers, which gave the regime the power to declare a State of Emergency and pass anti-terrorism laws which gave the regime almost unlimited power. In parliamentary elections in 1997, the regime, still heavily controlled by the military, swept back to parliament in a poll that Freedom House says heavily restricted freedom of expression and association and was condemned by international observers as flawed (Freedom House, 1998) . Regarding corruption, in his article 'Algeria: A Future Hijacked by Corruption', Djilali Hadjadj said that while Bendjedid's introduction of a multi-party system was partly in response to systemic corruption, corruption continued to flourish in all levels of government through the 1990s (Hadjadj 2007, p 264) . He said that already corrupt system was exacerbated in 1994 and 1995, when Algeria was forced to negotiate to reschedule its foreign debt with the International Monetary Fund. This resulted in a disastrous structural adjustment programme that had serious social and economic consequences, one of which was new infusions of money going into corrupt networks instead of being used to meet the country's needs (Hadjadj 2007, p 264) . Hadjadj also wrote that corruption was rampant in the judiciary, which was supposed to be independent under the constitution, but in reality was subject to the authority of the executive branch, and as such, many magistrates sought personal benefit in order to block investigations and other such matters for the regime. ====== Justifications: Q4: For this question, I went by the 1991 election, which was largely deemed free and fair. However, the barrier was that the opposition -- the Islamist group -- was barred by the military from becoming government, a rather serious barrier that this question didn't really allow for as Algeria descended into civil war and authoritarianism again as a result of this. Q5: Again, for the 1991 election there was widespread suffrage. But this was marked down because of some women being prevented from voting. Q6: Again, for the 1991 election. There was an effective, and popular, opposition -- it just wasn't allowed to govern. Q13: This one was difficult to answer because as far as I could tell, there wasn't really a situation of minorities as it was a case of government allies vs. government enemies.

"Equatorial Guinea",1998,2013,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Political Rights: All the sources I found point to political rights in Equatorial Guinea between 1998 and 2013 being thorough supressed with tight control maintained by the Executive. This has allowed President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has maintained power since 1979 when he overthrew his uncle Francisco Macías Nguema in a coup d'etat ( http://web.archive.org/web/20080612161320/http://www.dangardner.ca/Featnov605.html ) . Although Equatorial Guinea has universal suffrage and a voting age of 18 these facts do not really count for much in securing meaningful political freedoms. To begin with I looked at websites of organizations such as Freedom House and Human Rights Watch to establish the level of political rights in the country. Freedom House has consistently ranked Equatorial Guinea as 'Not Free'between 1998 and 2013, scoring them a 7 most years (the lowest score) for political rights. For example, although elections do occur Freedom House noted in 2003 that 'Equatorial Guinea's citizens are unable to change their government through peaceful, democratic means' and that during the presidential elections in 2002 government officials 'were present at polling stations and were opening ballot envelopes after votes were cast' . Similarly they state that the presidential elections in 2009 along with parliamentary elections in 1999, 2004, 2008 and 2013 were not free and fair, each returning Obiang to power by huge margins or allowing his Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea and their allies to maintain of the countries legislature ( https://freedomhouse.org/country/equatorial-guinea#.VV5Kqvmqqko ) . A referendum in 2011 giving the executive even greater powers also passed following intimidation and harassment of opposition ( http://www.egjustice.org/post/flawed-referendum ) . While there is an opposition, the Convergence for Social Democracy, they have virtually no chance at gaining political power (they won 1 seat out of 100 in the last parliamentary elections) and their activities are closely monitored although they are active and visible within. Hence I had to give Equatorial Guinea a score to 2 for question 6, which I thought was too high given the reality inside the nation but it was the only choice that really fitted. More information can be found here: http://africanelections.tripod.com/gq.html https://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/WorstOfTheWorst2011.pdf http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/11/24/equatorial-guinea-human-rights-concerns-taint-election Accesses to political power is primarily given on to those from Obiang's own clan ( http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=country&category=&publisher=MRGI&type=&coi=GNQ&rid=&docid=4954ce2a2&skip=0 ) and in the period 2002 -2013 media independent media was heavy suppressed (Reporters Without Boarders features many articles such as this http://en.rsf.org/equatorial-guinea-police-seize-opposition-newspaper-14-06-2005,14075.html ) and Freedom House continually ranked the country 'Not Free'in terms of freedom of the press ( https://freedomhouse.org/country/equatorial-guinea#.VV5TGvmqqkp ) . Civil Liberties: As with political rights, Equatorial Guinea between 1998 and 2013 was a repressive and unequal society. I found the Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) to be a useful tool for assessing civil liberties, in addition to the likes of Freedom House and Human Rights Watch. On a scale of 1 to 100 the IIAG continually ranked Equatorial Guinea in the mid-twenties for rule of law between 2001 and 2011 ( http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/interact/ ) . Looking forward to 2014 when Obiang's son and likely successor was forced to settle with the U.S. Department of Justice for money laundering ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/102077842 ) but has not faced any discipline in Equatorial Guinea, it seems reasonable to conclude that during the period 1998 to 2013 similar actions took place where the leaders of the state acted above the law but faced no penalties. I cannot find evidence that the rule of law is not upheld in criminal and civil matters involving 'everyday'citizens. Hence a score of 1 for question 9. Every year since 1998 Freedom House has reported something to the effect of: 'With partial exception for members of legalized political parties, freedom of association and assembly is restricted. Authorization must be obtained for any gathering of ten or more people for purposes the government deems political. Freedom of domestic and international travel is also restricted. ' Hence a score of 1 for question 10. Freedom House notes that Equatorial Guinea does not have an independent judiciary. Human rights watch adds that: ' Although the constitution nominally recognizes the principle of judicial independence, it designates the president as the 'chief magistrate' of the country and permits him to name Supreme Court justices and others without parliamentary approval. The International Bar Association, following a visit to Equatorial Guinea in 2003, concluded that, 'The courts are not independent and impartial,' citing in part 'direct intervention from the president in order to protect his personal interests' and expectations that judges demonstrate 'loyalty' to the government. Multiple sources indicate that the situation remains unchanged. Lawyers in Equatorial Guinea interviewed by EG Justice in 2011 said that judges assigned to sensitive cases concerning human rights or national security regularly tell the lawyers that the judges needed to consult with the office of the president regarding their decisions. ' ( http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/11/11/equatorial-guinea-move-consolidate-power ) For these reasons I scored the country 0 for question 11. The same report continues: The president exercises heavy influence over members of the legislature& undermining the potential& [for it] to act as a check on his power. The ruling party, and other parties aligned with it, control 99 of 100 seats in parliament. The legislature almost exclusively acts under the direction or at the request of the presidency and consistently rubber-stamps presidential initiatives. ' Therefor I again rated the country 0 for question 12. The Fang ethnic group (to which the president belongs) make up at least 80% of the population. The treatment of the Bubi ethnic group has been poor and they have very limited political representation ( http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=country&category=&publisher=MRGI&type=&coi=GNQ&rid=&docid=4954ce2a2&skip=0 ) . Hence a 0 for question 13. I am fairly confident in the answers I have given and feel I have researched thoroughly using credible sources. A few educated guesses have been made so I scored myself 4 for question 14 but over all I am confident my answers do a good job of assessing the situation inside Equatorial Guinea. Corruption: Corruption is extremely pervasive in Equatorial Guinea but concentrated at certain levels. The oil state, with high per capita GDP and rapid economic growth, has allocated very little to funds for public works, health care and education. A 2009 Human Rights Watch report stated that 'the broader population& enjoys little of the benefit and has not been lifted from poverty, while the elite directs the country's newfound wealth into its own pockets ' ( http://www.hrw.org/node/84252/section/1 ) . Corruption it seems is undertaken almost exclusively by political elites while the rest of the citizenry is left to scrape out a living in any way possible.",1,3,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,4,1,8,2,10
"Guyana",1990,2015,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Political Rights to gauge the extent of political rights among citizens of this country I used a combination of Academic analysis, media outlets and NGO reports. These included 'Ethnic politics and public sector management in Trinidad and Guyana, by Deryck R. Brown. Stories from Kaieteur news, for example 'David A Granger Sworn in as Guyana's 8 th Executive President, and studies from the World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples NGO. After comparing the evidence from these sources I was able to paint an accurate picture of Guyana's political landscape. Although Guyana has in name free and fair elections, with no legislative discrimination as to who can run or form political parties, their system is far from ideal. For nearly three decades the same political party controlled the government (this is also in part due to the five year terms of office), a situation that has only recently ended with the swearing in of David Granger as the new Executive President. However even this most recent election has been marred by accusations of election fraud. Historically most of this fraud surrounded the counting of special votes cast by Guyana nationals living internationally. Accusations have been made that in some cases more special votes were cast than there were actual international citizens, with these extra votes favouring the incumbent. I scored most of the political rights questions around two points, as there are characteristics of a free political environment in Guyana but it is significantly hampered by fraud, corruption and the consolidation of power by one party. Civil Liberties In this section I used sources such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), INews Guyana, and Country studies US, a website that contains the on-line versions of books published by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress . Through this analysis I answered the Civil Liberties questions with a mean of two. Guyana has many of the systems we associate with civil liberty; free media, an independent judiciary and groups charged with bettering Indigenous rights. However they suffer the same challenges as seen in the political rights section. In a recent attempt by the CIDA to assist with new media laws to encourage free and responsible media, the government withdrew its support of the initiative at the last minute, hampering its effectiveness significantly. Further to this leaders in the judiciary are appointed by the government, something that gives them all though not total control, significant influence. Lastly recent changes to the structure of Indigenous initiatives have come under criticism for centralizing power within government bodies at the expense of indigenous NGO groups and local organizations. Finally in Order to assess the corruption levels of Guyana I utilized a Transparency International report of the state of corruption in Guyana. Unfortunately this report came with the caveat that there is very little solid evidence around corruption in the country. For this reason their results were more forecasts and expected trends rather than actual data. However they were still confident in saying that there is wide spread corruption in both political and business spheres, details however were hard to attain.",1,3,2,2,2,3,2,1,2,2,4,0,10,10,20
"Georgia",2012,2013,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Georgia is in a very interesting period of political change. The questions were, at times, very difficult to answer, as these changes are in constant flux. There are growing political efforts made to solve Georgia's historic corruption and human rights problems that occured within the last decade, e.g. new legislation passed to protect minority groups, and formal anti-corruption actions acted upon (e.g. recent dismissals of corrupt ministers by the prime minister) . Questions relating to their constitutional structure were difficult because it is very complex. Most notably, a system of checks and balances does exists to ecourage judical independance, however, it is still very vulnerable to the influence from the executive branch. The main point to reiterate is that there is a heavy focus on reform in Georgia, with slow but steady improvements being sought. While in the middle of this transition, Georgia as a country has made considerable progress since the presidential elections of 2012, where a new government has been making visable and ligitimate efforts to improve equality and human rights.",3,3,3,3,3,1,2,1,2,3,4,2,15,9,24
"Jamaica",1992,2006,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","It was difficult to find sources and had to depend a lot on websites, so how correct my answers are, I am not sure. I chose the period 1992-2006 because this was how long the prime minister was in office for and he appeared to make conscious efforts to improve the economy and create transparency, and is known for that also... While elections are free and fair, there was also incredibly low voter turnout. In 1997, barely 30% voted and in 2002, just over 50% voted. Jamaica has a high murder rate and violence tends to skyrocket around election times, with party supporters target other party supporters. Media is private and free, but self-censor to avoid public backlash. The criminal system also fails to control masses and there is not a very strong judiciary. There are minority parties but competition is usually between only 2 parties and the chances of being elected are fairly equal, though the prime minister during 1992-2006 was elected three times before he retired, he was the first black man to be elected so perhaps gave him some staying power being able to relate to the majority of Jamaica. There are numerous amounts of human rights abuses, especially from police and mobs. The corruption boxes I ticked above a based on rumoured corruption (such as gang-party partnerships) which are strongly regarded to be true by much of the public. There are many attempts to avoid fraud during elections such as finger-printing and ID cards, but not all are collected and there is plenty of opportunity for fraud ('overvote') .

"Slovakia",1994,1998,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Corruption as merriam-webster states is definied as 'dishonest or illegal behavior especially by powerful people (such as government officials or police officers) '. In regard to the question above, i believe that the Slovak Republic over the time period of 1994 (one year after formation) to 1998 was a deeply corrupt state. My first example of the corruption is the son of the opposition party was kidnapped in 1994 and left beaten in Austia. Involvement by the government was heavily denied although the son stated that the opposition party was most definitely invovled, most specifically the SIS who report directly to the president. WHen questioned the SIS refused to allow their personel to be questioned over the case, and in turn a police chief resigned from the police force due to pressure while another officer was dropped from the case. In the same case, a journalist who was covering the case was subject to surveillance (misuse of public resources) and was beaten. Months after this occured a opposition politician was put under surveillance for two days and subsequently beaten. In each of these cases the government officials sought to discredit the victims case and downplay the alleged role of the government. In questioning the son who was kidnapped 'In September the President's son reported that police investigators, while questioning him in connection with his abduction, revealed knowledge of his private domestic conversations that could only have been obtained by electronic surveillance. There were no reports of mail tampering.' This is important as mail tampering as well as wire tapping has to go through a process that is given legitimacy by the judicial system. There was no report of the Son being under surveillance so this points to a misuse of surveillance tools as well as corruption in the sense of short-cutting processes which uphold the human rights of civilians. In regard to corruption I believe the Slovak media to be heavily corrupt. During the time period mentioned, the Slovak government pressed for private owned media, converting much of its government broadcasters into private entitites. While this does not fit under corruption it is important to note that ' Opposition views are given scant coverage in news programs. Slovak television also carries relatively little coverage of the activities of the President, who has been the target of repeated attacks by members of the governing coalition. In April it refused to broadcast a speech by the President, although it has carried others' This misuse of the Media i believe fits under the definition of corruption as the people in charge of the Media are blatantly manipulating the public through their personal agendas. In this case i believe the options above did not cover corruption in the way in which it was undertaken in the Slovak Republic.",3,3,3,3,1,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,13,8,21
"Czech Republic",2009,2009,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Other""","My first country is Czech Republic, and the request is to study this country in the period of 2009. Czech Republic is a state that is landlocked in Central Europe. It is a pluralist multi-party parlimentary representative democracy, with the Prime Minister as the head of the government. The year of 2009 was politically disruptive in the Czech Republic since the government was collapsed in March of the same year, as the government has rejected and denied any plans for earlier election to be held. Since the government was unstable and a shaky ground the topple of Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek's cabinet was something expected, while the government was performing bad since the time that they step in power. Czech Republic enjoy free and fair elections for either state's executive and legislature. It is an electoral democracy state. The country allow universal suffrage. The state of Czech Republic as most of the European democratic states allow universal suffrage. in Czech Republic all people who who are over 18 have the right to vote and so the inability to vote is only posed in some restrictions, such for those who are well below the legal age for voting or other factors that prevent people to vote, for instance, legal barriers. Regarding Czech government and its opposition in the year of 2009, this year showed a that the state within that time were enjoying a good opposition party and corrupted regime. The collapse of the Czech Republic government on that time, showed the strength of the opposition party who owned ambitious to take over the government. However, the opposition has to achieve its goal and gain the power. After unsuccessful attempts the Czech Social Democratic Party opposition has fallen to bring the Cabinet down. The Topolanek's Civic Democratic Party and the opposition party of Czech Social Democratic Party have called for an election, the result that the election showed was in favor for the ODS with a big gab between the two parties results, by 31.5% for the ODS party and 22.4% for the CSSD opposition party. This proves that, there is opposition in the Czech Republic state however, this opposition is not strong enough to overthrow the government and take over its position even in weaknesses time of the ruling party and bad performance as happened in the Czech Republic case of study in the period of 2009, at the time of irrevocably weakness of the ruling party and its lack of ability to conduct the situation as required and dispite the imbalance the government suffering the the Czech Social Democratic Party failed to achieve its aspirations. Do people have access to political power? The lower rate in election turnout in the year of the study, 2009, puts before us the hypothesis of that the people of Czech Republic have limited access to political power. In the election that was carried out in 2009, of a number of registration people of 8,401,374 registered persons only 2,371,009 have voted making a percentage of 28% of the whole number of registration. This might be because of the limited access of political power. some might think this might be because of the fact that there was no compulsory voting but the previous elections has showed slight good result. Media act as a check and balance on power? The freedom of opinion and other's opinion, freedom of press is constitutionally guaranteed under the rights that any democratic state should provide for its different sectors. On the other hand, the government has restrictions over the media. these restrictions are appointed in speech that might infringe on national security, public health, individual rights, morality, that evoke hater on race, ethnicity. Censorship exist in some of the times. The broadcast media is always regulated by the Czech Radio and Television Broadcasting Council, while the Czech television is regulated and controlled by its own council. However, the Print media is more likely to be self-regulated. Therefore, Independent media exist in the Print ones which act as a real check and balance on power, while other media is regulated by councils that are authorized by the state. Does the regime uphold the rule of law? The Czech Republic government of 2009 has upheld the rule of law, exept some of the issues that the government has failed to address. This things form in the fact of how the government is treating minorties and how it is dealing with the elections matters. Therefore, in this case we mentioned the injustice which subjected on the Roma's minority and the low turnout in election. All people within the regime have exercised their general rights of, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and expression. Free independent and fair judiciary? Czech Republic has free independent and fair judiciary, and its know and defined by the Constitution and based on that the court exercise their duties as being an independent authorities. The Czech Republic like many countries fell into the trap of inequality intentionally or by mistake. and here we can appoint to the Roma's minority who are being discriminated against in Czech Republic state. Romas have limited access to education and live in the country side. The issue of this minor group is old age problem that remain unfixed. the Czech is considered being moderate in the scale of corruption. In 2009 the country was ranked as the 52 in the world, with rate of 49% of not being corrupted. The corruption exists in many forms, for example the performance of the economy, political financial funding, the lack of fair and free election and inequality among the society. With regard to Czech Republic, corruption lies on the negligence of sensitive issues such as equality to minorities, upholding the rule of law in the requested way. some of the question above was really difficult to answer either because the suggested answers did not fit with the country or because of the lack of information that is published about the particular matter. Due to the difficulty of finding the exact information, some of my answers were guesses which is predicted from other events.",3,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,1,10,10,20
"Bahrain",2002,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","I chose the 2002-2010 period in which the state of Bahrain had already become a constitutional monarchy and before the 2011 uprisings because it represented the most stability of the regimes around my reference year of 2010. Elections in Bahrain are not free and fair, political parties are illegal, de facto political parties operate and are known as 'political societies' there is much influencing occurring by the state in favour of the state. There are no foreign monitors allowed to cover elections and the independent human rights society for Bahrain has previously been ousted from the polls, there is also very little chance of regime change. Voting rights are highly restricted only native Bahrainis over the age of 20 can vote, so 300,000 of a total 1 million. The head of state is the King and all power resides with him, he selects the high councils and judges and has the authority to overrule the lower house, therefore judiciary are not independent, with the courts often coming under pressure, and accountability of this regime is minimal. All senior positions within government are held by the Royal family. Media in Bahrain is often controlled by the state, opposition media is typically banned and whilst foreign reporters can cover the vote, they have been known to be banned and there are no foreign monitors. The constitution that entrenched this regime emphasises rights of freedom, freedom of speech, press, cultural protection but law restricts the flow of these rights, especially the right to assembly, public gatherings or demonstrations must be submitted to the Ministry of the Interior at least 72 hours in advance. Bahrain has some anti corruption laws, but enforcement is weak, and high-ranking officials suspected of corruption are rarely punished. Government officials have been recognised for taking resources from the public purse, damaging the economy and fueling popular grievances. Ethnic minorities do have some sort of freedoms but they are still restricted in their ability to run for office. Non-Muslim minorities are generally free to practice their faiths. All religious groups must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs to operate legally. Foreign workers are also not protected by the labor law and lack the right to organize. The most difficult thing was to find substantial evidence of corruption rather than pieces alluding to corrupt practices.",2,1,2,1,2,0,1,0,0,2,4,1,8,3,11
"Rwanda",2003,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","The time period that has been chosen for the study of Rwanda political regime is the period from 2003 to 2014. The political regime of this period was non-democratic. Despite the regime's effort to adopt certain democratic practices, it has yet to transform into a democracy. Rwanda suffered from a devastating civil war in which genocide of the Tutsi ethnic group occurred in 1994. Since the end of the civil war, Rwanda struggled to establish a stable political system that could effectively manage the ethnic division. The politics of Rwanda under this political regime has been overshadowed by the issue of stability and ethnic division. The Constitution of 2003 has established the political foundation for present-day Rwanda. Rwanda has a presidential system in which the president is both the head of state and the head of government. During this period, there have been peaceful transitions of power however power remains concentrated and the electoral practices did not reflect democratic principles. There is a separation of power between three branches of the government, legislative, executive, and judiciary. The legislative branch has a bicameral parliament that is made up of the Chambers of Deputies and the Senate. The Chambers of Deputies consists of 53 elected members as well as 27 indirectly elected quota members from different groups of society (females, youth, and the disabled) . It appears the regime has attempted to adopt democratic ideals of representation through creating quotas for some groups of society. However, these chamber members are not directly elected and can be subjected to the influence of the government-of-the-day. The Senate is made up of members elected by provincial councils, appointees of the president and university staff. There are no direct elections for the senate. The executive branch composes of the president, prime minister, and ministers appointed by the president. Power is concentrated in the executive branch. Moreover, the president's terms last for seven years, which can lead to the consolidation of the president's powers. The judiciary branch consists of multiple levels of courts, the highest court being the Supreme Court. Since the civil war, the judiciary has been occupied with cases concerning the perpetrators of the genocide. However, the Rwandan judiciary is seen as being influenced by the executive. According to Human Rights Watch, there have been cases of detainment without charge, false charges of members of government, falsification of evidence, and interference by the executive in prosecution. Moreover, people who raise controversial issues or question the government was often charged with 'divisionism' or 'genocide ideology' . These charges reflect Rwanda's terrible past and make it difficult for others oppose it. The judiciary is often seen as an important part of the practice of the rule of law and monitoring the actions of the government, however in Rwanda, the judiciary is influenced by the executive which has resulted in multiple cases of injustice. Despite, Rwanda's attempt to democratize, the elections in Rwanda in this political regime remains largely undemocratic. Since 2003, elections are held for both the legislative and executive branch, however, elections are neither free nor fair. In 2003, Rwanda held its first presidential election since the Rwandan Civil War and genocide in 1994. The presidential election in 2003 brought Paul Kagame into power. During 2003-2014 period, legislative elections occurred in 2003, 2008, and 2013. And the most recent presidential election was in 2010, in which Kagame remains the president of Rwanda. In 2006, Rwanda was considered as not free with bad scores for political rights. The scores remained the same until 2014. European Union observers discovered that there were problems of fraud, intimidation, manipulation of lists, and ballot box stuffing, and lack of transparency in counting of the votes. More importantly, there was little secrecy in the voting process because voters had to print their fingers rather than marking pen or stamp, the votes were not anonymous as the fingerprints can be used to identify voters. Despite having elections, opposition parties were unable to gain any significant power. Throughout 2003-2014, the dominant party was the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), the party that won the civil war and establishes the post-civil war government. The party belongs to the Tutsi ethnic group who were the target in the genocide. The established power of the RPF made it difficult for any significant contestation of power. The parties that competed in the elections were aligned with the president and RPF. In 2003 elections, the ban on political organizations was lifted, however, political parties that were seen as promoting ethnic divisions has been banned to prevent future ethnic conflicts. The Rwandan government has been in support of ethnic equality especially because the dominant party, the minority Tutsi is in power. However, Rwanda's ethnic division had led to the restriction of political freedoms and rights. There is no freedom of speech or assembly. The majority of the media is controlled by the government and the RPF. Although, changes have been made allowing for the liberalization of media, but the change was insignificant. Once again, the government's reasoning for the restriction of political rights is the issue of ethnic division and conflict. Rwanda also faces problems of corruption. Despite, the centralization of power of the government that can possibly lead to the abuse of power by those in power, the regime has put a lot of effort on reducing corruption. According to Transparency International Rwanda report, between 2005 and 2009, the perceived frequency of corruption occurs in business and privileges for friends and family of government officials. At the individual level, corruption happens in forms of giving money and at the institutional level there public institutions are more corrupt than private institutions. Moreover, the most corrupt institution is the National Police that often accept bribes. The main corruption issue that exists in the judiciary is bribes given to judges to reduce the penalty. Generally, corruption happens at lower and local level of government rather than among top officials. However, high-level corruption was not unheard of. In 2005, the minister of agriculture and ambassadors to France, Ethiopia, and African Union were removed from office because of corruption and embezzlement charges. President Kagame prioritized good governance and corruption reduction. Consequently, between 2008 and 2011 corruption cases processed by prosecutor increased from 75% to 80%. The government has been active in educating the people against corruption. Rwanda ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Prevention of Combating Corruption. More importantly, Rwanda CPI ranking improved from being no. 121 in 2006 to being no. 55 in 2014. Rwanda has made significant improvement in reducing corruption under the political regime.

"Mexico",1996,2001,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Mexico 1996 was a life changing year in Mexico. The Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) began their fall from power in the Mexican government, where once they ruled absolutely. The PRI dominated Mexican politics from around the 1930s up until 1994, using many incentives to keep the party in government. It was in 1996 that the then president Ernesto Zedillo proposed electoral reform to eliminate political instability (Garrido de Sierra, 2012) . It was this reform which changed politics in Mexico as the reform allowed for a new government to start to move in. With this electoral reform, the economic collapse, opportunities in the international market and economic liberalisation all lead to the PRI eventually losing power (Garrido de Sierra, 2012) . I will be looking at the period of 1996- 2001 as this is where the change in government can be seen. In the 1997 elections no majority was found in the mid- term elections and the chamber of deputies was handed to Muñoz Ledo, one of the founders for the Party of the Democratic Revolution. While in 2000 the Mexican government changed hands for the first time since 1929. Under the National Action Party (PAN) Vicente Fox was president from 2000 winning with 43 percent of the vote (Shahani, 2012) . These years provide a look into Mexico moving away from government officials regularly bribing the public into what became a free and fair system. The reforms in 1996 allowed for opposition parties to be on a more level playing field with the PRI. The significant change was when the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), a group which is completely separate from the governing bodies, began conducting the elections. This change allowed for the Mexican elections to be regarded as 'fraud- proof' (Peschard-Sverdrup, 1997) . The reforms the IFE put into place, including access to media, gave the opposition parties greater potential to govern and challenge the PRI (Peschard-Sverdrup, 1997) . While the 1996 election was won by the PRI, it is thought that there were competitive and transparent free and fair elections with a high chance of the governing arrangements changing as a result of them. The success of the IFE is obvious when looking at the 2000 election, where the National Action Party took over parliament. With these reforms it was clear that there were now competitive, transparent free and fair elections with a high chance of the governing arrangements changing as a result in Mexico. The country also has universal suffrage (Freedom house, 1999) . That is, it allows for all persons, over the age of 18 to vote. The introduction of the IFE also brought with it identification cards, which people used when they went to vote. The voting cards meant the possibility of electoral fraud was very small and facilitated the prospect of a fairer system in the state. It was also compulsory to vote in the state (Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, n.d.) . Due to the IFE becoming an independent body, the electoral process was regarded as 'fraud-proof' and as Peschard-Sverdrup (1997) states the new reforms allowed for opposition parties to become likely candidates for election as was seen in 2000. Although the PRI still held majority of government in 1996 under Zedillo, the 1997 midterm elections showed their majority dwindling. It is for this reason that I would say Mexico developed a significant opposition with a likelihood of being able to gain power in an election. During the rule of the PRI in Mexico, I believe that it could be said that the majority of people did not have any access to political power; as power was concentrated within an elite few. However, I am focusing on the years 1997- 2001 where there was a change of government and the country was moving into democracy which leads me to conclude that many people have access to political power, with some exceptions . The exceptions are due to circumstances like the mid- term election in 1997 where Muñoz Ledo became president of the Chamber of Deputies. Due to the PRI's power over the state, this was prevented but eventually allowed (Acosta, 2008) . The election shows that while many have access to political power, the power can also be concentrated within the elites who don't wish for change. While the state held reforms to make the elections less biased towards one party, the media is still very biased. Joseph Chappell H. Lawson stated that as on 1997 the media was able to show propaganda of all three parties and not just present PRI propaganda (Chappell H. Lawson, 2002) . There were many deaths in Mexico involving journalists, at least seven journalists were killed in Mexico from 1996 to 2000 (Committee to Protect Journalists, n.d.) . This reflects why Reporters without Borders stated Mexico had 'noticeable problems' in terms of their free press (Kholsa, 2014) . For these reasons it is believed that though there is no state censorship, a degree of self-censorship may exist, or there is substantial government influence on what is reported . As the Economist (2014) points out it wasn't till 2000 that democracy started to seriously begin in Mexico, although rule of law was not implemented fully when democracy began. The PRI still ruled much of the state through organisations such as the police and enforced political control in the states. In another sense Mexico was ruled by organised crime, particularly that of drugs. Much of the drug flow into the United States flows from Mexico. The state also allows for corrupt individuals, particularly politicians, to be protected and not punished by the government (The Economist, 2014) . It is for these reasons that the leaders (or ex-leaders) of the state are not subject to the rule of law . America Quarterly (2012) points out that prior to 1994 general elections were largely a façade to show the power that the PRI held within the state. That is there was no independent body like Mexico has now, the IFE, which was able to regulate the elections and due to this official tallies almost always showed the PRI had an absolute majority win. It was found that the election results were manipulated to show these preferences. Though American Quarterly (2012) shows that after the IFE was put into place the judiciary began to act independently, there was still concerns of influence within the state (Shahani, 2012) . The judiciary is operated independently and transparently, but there are some concerns about political influence in Mexico. In 1999 the state according to Freedom House (1999) had a civil liberties rating of four out of seven, with one being best. The rating shows that Mexico has struggled with civil liberties over the years. While in Mexico there are human rights groups and pro-democracy forums, these groups have been subject to intimidation. Freedom House (1999) reports that while an official human rights commission was set up in the 1990s the commission was not allowed to enforce recommendations on political and labour violations. Also the government used forms of intimidation such as anonymous death threats to those who opposed the current government position (Freedom House, 1999) . Although, religious freedom was said to be constitutionally upheld and protected by the state. It is shown that there is there are legal and statutory rights, but there is active social and procedural discrimination and inequality towards groups or minorities. Also, fundamental human rights partially exist though there is heavy suppression of these, such as how the human rights commission was set up though they were unable to enforce recommendations. Mexico in 1997 had a lower congress held by a separate party. This allowed for unbiased opinions within the government. However, the lower congress was also undermined by bribery. Therefore, I believe that while the state did have active civil liberties to hold the regime accountable these were constantly undermined and thus ineffective i.e. somewhere in between (Chappell H. Lawson, 2002) . Transparency International (2015) rates the corruption in Mexico during 1999 3.4 out of ten and in 2000 3.3 with countries such as Denmark and New Zealand being the countries with the least corrupt and Nigeria being one of the most corrupt seen. This puts Mexico in the middle of these groups, though I would say, on the basis of the evidence above, it was more corrupt than what the number seems to imply. Over 85 percent of Mexico City believed that corruption is widespread with in the state said Stephen D. Morris (n.d.) . Around 60 percent of internal auditor's encountered corruption at some level whilst supervising and in Mexico City over 60 percent of those surveyed stated that it was sometimes necessary to bribe in order to resolve a conflict (Morris, n.d) . These statistics show that corruption was widespread throughout the state and did not just reside in the work of government officials, therefore it is necessary to state that corruption was pervasive from the head of government to low-level government workers during 1997- 2001. As noted above corruption was present in many places but particularly in bribe-taking by public officials, special privileges granted to politically-connected people, misuse of public resources by top officials and condoning of illegal business dealings. The above answers provide reasonable evidence for each of the questions on the Regime Classification exercise. Therefore I would rate my confidence in my answers at 5.4 as I thoroughly researched the Mexican state not just focusing on using one website and used this information to make a qualified assessment. Due to the years of the PRIs demise being heavily documented I did not find it very difficult to find research on 1996- 2001 and answer the questions during about those years. References Acosta, L.

"China",1989,2002,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","The political rights section of the questions were simple to answer as China between the period 1994-2002 were (and still is) on the extreme end of political freedom (i.e. no political freedom (Score: 0/15) . Using the resources found on the internet, especially 'freedom house' as the questions were mainly based off this site, I found that China political rights status being 'Worst of the Worst' (Freedom House) as the country scored a '7' out of 7 which is the worst score for political freedom. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) elites have complete control over who becomes the leader (s) of the state as there are no elections held in the state to decide leadership roles. The public has no political say on who becomes part of the elite and the elite can remove any opposition they might face in their party (e.g. high ranking political military leaders) which relates to the corruption section. No voting means no universal suffrage. Ordinary people have no right to access political power unless they are permitted (must be heavily screened over years of service and dedication to the party) or considered eligible to join. Recruitment from youth is possible though. Slight exception to political dominance occurs in the 'Special Administration Regions'of China. Hong Kong and Macau are the only exceptions to absolute political freedom in China as these two regions use to be controlled by foreign powers Great Britain (Hong Kong) and Portugal (Macau) . After their return in 1997 (HK) and 1999 (Macau), they were allowed to use their own media, judicial and political systems to an extent as there still CCP monitor. Civil liberties of the state are almost just as bad in as their political freedom, hence the low civil liberties score (2/15) . Freedom House rated China's civil liberties a 6 out of 7 (7=worst) (an increase from 7/7) only due to changes to a decrease in 'state intrusion into personal lives of citizens.' The media is heavily censored and any media outlets are completely controlled by the government. No open criticism of CCP is permitted. The judicial system is controlled by the CCP. Judges are mainly loyalists to the CCP and high levels of corruption occur in all levels of government from bribes for favourable judicial outcomes and the use of torture and harassment is also present. Therefore judicial system is not free or fair. There is no balance of power of any form to hold the CCP accountable to any actions. The CCP heavily persecute minorities especially those in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Tibet. Restricting the practices of their faith and limiting their freedoms such as public gatherings. Opportunities are different for those in urban and rural areas with better benefits to those in the cities. Restrictions to mobility (eg. Migration to urban areas) is also present. Corruption as explained above is very present in the country from all levels of government. From the taking of regional resources by officials (e.g. Xinjiang) to removal of political opponents by government elites and also the poor judicial system; China is definitely a state that is NOT FREE.

"Haiti",2006,2011,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Question Four: Haiti conducts elections for their government however, there are many issues that surround this. The elections are not entirely free or fair. There have been allegations for years that the electoral process is riddled with corruption. The public is free to vote for whomever they please; however, there are efforts by opposing parties to prevent this from happening. The Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) has been the object of boycott by several political parties. The public has been calling for boycott on elections because of lack of fairness and transparency. An article by the Institute of Justice and Democracy in Haiti, states that the CEP lacks authenticity in Haiti for reasons such as it being picked by President Preval, a previous CEP, with many of the same members, made an effort to exclude members of Haiti's largest political party (Famni Lavalas) from senatorial elections, and excluded a further 15 parties from the Parliamentary elections. Thus, elections are ambiguous when it comes to how 'free' or 'fair' they really are. http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/72E4371CA4A52631852577E4007115E3-Full_Report.pdf Question Five: This country offers universal suffrage in the fact that all adults (over eighteen) are able to vote. Question Six: In Haiti, the ruling party, Lespwa has several opposing parties such as the Rally of Progressive National Democrats, Fanmi Lavalas and the Democratic Alliance Party. There is the opportunity for one of these parties to be elected to govern, however, as stated before, there are allegations and corruption within the Provisional Electoral Council stops particular parties from being allowed to participate, often without credible reason. In some cases, presidents have found a loophole that can prevent elections form being held at all, meaning the legislature could not mess with the executive's agenda. http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/72E4371CA4A52631852577E4007115E3-Full_Report.pdf http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/13/haitian-election-impasse-has-roots-in-dictatorships-past Question Seven: This question was difficult to find a definitive answer, however based from the information available, it was safest to conclude the only those with considerable wealth could access political power. Preval came to power through his association with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Haiti is very poor and impoverished, only those with significant wealth have the funds and time to do this. However, the public can access political power through ways of petition. Question Eight: The government does not censor media in Haiti. Constitutionally, journalists are allowed exercise their profession without censorship from the government. However, Freedom House explains that under the conditions of poverty, corruption of the judiciary and the tradition of partial media coverage, their jobs can be difficult. There are however, instances where journalists have been threatened or attacked. There have also been instances where the judiciary has failed to respond to journalist's murders in the past. Additionally, Transparency International have ranked Haiti 52/179 countries on their press freedom index. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2008/haiti#.VV6mHkJ0ba4 http://www.transparency.org/country#HTI Question Nine: Again, information is sparse, however it appears that many leaders are not subject to the rule of law. This answer fit best because often leaders, Preval for example, do things the law does not allow with zero consequences. For example holding elections when they are due, rather than undemocratically, continually pushing them back. Question Ten: All citizens have access to fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech. The Human Rights Commission's report states that Haiti has issues when it comes to inhumane conditions in prisons, weak government institutions, and no repercussions for human rights offences in the past. Question Eleven: This country does not have a free, independent judiciary. Transparency international have ranked Haiti 140/142 countries on judicial independence, making it one of the worst in the world. The law provides for an independent judiciary, however in reality the executive and legislative have significant influence over this branch. The judiciary still suffers structure issues from earlier dictatorship years. A major example of this is former president Jean-Claude Duvalier, who was responsible for many human rights crimes in the twentieth century, involving torturing and killing Haitians. The judiciary decided to pardon Duvalier, proving that the justice system is on the side of the rich and powerful elite. https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/31/haiti-duvalier-ruling-disappoints-justice Question Twelve: This regime does not have processes to keep the governing party accountable. Does investigate alleged breaches, for example the investigations electoral fraud in 2006. However, these investigations rarely make a lot of difference. There is a small budget for the Office of the Ombudsman and next to no information about the implementation of its recommendations. http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2033387,00.html",1,2,2,1,2,1,2,0,1,1,3,0,8,5,13
"Afghanistan",2009,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Investigating Afghanistan's government proved to be somewhat difficult, as I found a lot of information that was contradictory and biased to some extent. I believe this to be a result of the fact that the West has spent over a trillion dollars fighting the Taliban since 2001 and to this day there is not a lot to show for it. Traditional Western media seems to paint the conquest as successful but when I looked a little deeper the situation is better but still in no way at all satisfactory. Due to these factors I concluded the failures to institute a strong state and stabilize Afghan society is a source of embarrassment for many western powers that had promised so much more. Afghanistan is still thwart by the scourge of war, corruption and oppression although there is evidence that this is not an integral part of the regime, more so a result of decades of fighting. The Brutality of the Taliban regime that started in 1996 when they seized power in a coup has severely tainted the country and has left a fragmented society. Although removed from government in 2001 the absence of strong, corruption free state systems has meant that large parts of Afghan society has resorted to self-governance and tribal justice. We can see this in many notable cases of brutal mob justice occurring in which unspeakable acts of violence occur to which authorities turn a blind eye. Afghanistan has major problems at many levels of government and in many parts of society that are prohibiting the creation of a cohesive, functional and just state. I chose to look at the time period between 2009 and 2015 as in this time period we saw the installation of a government via an election that can only be described as corrupt and major increases in insurgent violence. We also saw regression in many areas that in the subsequent 5 years had exhibited signs of improvement. In answering the provided questions I researched many sources of information including but not limited to: Freedom House, Transparency International, RAND, Foreign Policy, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Vice News and other mainstream media sources. In answering questions 4,5 and 6 I looked at the most recent 2009 election in which incumbent President Hamid Karzai secured another 5 year term when his opponent, ex-foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah withdrew in protest of the corrupt nature of the countries electoral system. I concluded that although a successful election had taken place, there were significant barriers in place prohibiting transparency. I also concluded that these barriers were not a creation of the regime rather a result of rampant corruption at all levels of government. It doesn't appear that to have been the result of coordinated effort and many issues can be localized. On the question of universal suffrage it became difficult to ascertain information that was to direct me to one of the given answers. I did conclude that suffrage does exist but due to violence, intimidation, societal beliefs and geographical factors significant barriers stand between citizen and electoral participation. Opposition parties do face significant barriers to gaining political power. Levels of political freedom are higher in urban centres, but violence, insecurity, and repression prevail nationwide. Critics have warned that the 2003 Political Parties Law's vague language could be exploited to deny registration to parties on flimsy grounds. In addition, analysts viewed the adoption of the single-non-transferable-vote system for the 2005 legislative elections as a disadvantage for new political parties. Afghan media is still subject to violent intimidation and physical attacks. A 2007 media law that was intended to clarify press freedoms and limit government interference has been somewhat negated as a growing number of journalists have been arrested, threatened, or harassed by politicians, security services, and other positions of power as a result of their coverage. Independent media does exist, but government and tribal warlords who do not stand for any anti-Islamic sentiment heavily monitor it. It appears that corruption works as an instrument to oppress rather free media rather than legislation. Access to political power is only available to those who are wealthy enough to afford it or those willing to fight for it. The parliament is made up of educated academic politicians, affiliated warlords and tribal leaders. The sectarian nature of the parliament has severe ramifications for its ability to produce legislation of quality and balance. The Rule of law is not applied consistently and the judiciary is viewed as one of the most corrupt organs of government. The judicial system operates haphazardly, and justice in many places is administered on the basis of a mixture of legal codes by inadequately trained judges. The Supreme Court, composed of religious scholars who have little knowledge of civil jurisprudence, is particularly in need of reform. Corruption in the judiciary is extensive, and judges and lawyers are often subject to threats from local leaders or armed groups. Traditional or mob justice is the main recourse for the population, especially in rural areas. Access to civil liberties is evident, though societal violence does prohibit the exercise of these liberties. The constitution guarantees the rights to assembly and association, subject to some restrictions, but they are upheld erratically from region to region. Police and other security personnel have occasionally used excessive force when confronting demonstrations. Afghanistan is notable for ignoring the rights of women. The track record they possess is utterly shocking and for the most part can be attributed to societal factors and an unwillingness to address these factors. Acid attacks, ruthless beatings and murder are common against woman and often spouses or family members commit these acts. The judicial system often ignores these acts of violence that further perpetuates the societal belief that it is somewhat acceptable. Some of my research suggested that some of the questions were not the correct questions to be asking due to the unique nature of the Afghan situation. Afghanistan is not so much an oppressive regime in the traditional sense like North Korea is, it is more so a developing country plagued by violence, corruption and societal beliefs that inhibit this process. It is better described as an oppressive society that is self perpetuating. Essentially Afghanistan is a failed state.",2,3,2,1,1,1,2,0,2,2,4,1,9,7,16
"Equatorial Guinea",2002,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","I will go through and justify my answers to each question starting from question four in a bullet point format: 4) There are consistent elections for the President as well as the legislature - the most recent was in 2009. These elections however are a complete sham, and according to reports by the BBC as well as Freedom House and Human Rights Watch, President Obiang and his Democratic Party are elected with figures of 95-99% of the total vote. Legally, only two political parties are registered - the Democratic Party, and the Convergence for Social Democracy (which is a puppet party which is under the control of Obiang to give the guise of political opposition. CSD won approximately 2.2% of the vote at the most recent election) . Obiang was reelected as President in 2009 with 95.4% of the total vote - and one constituency reportedly awarding him 103% of the regions vote. 5) There is unniversal sufferage with no restrictions on who can vote. However, in reality, votes from anyone who does not support Obiang are completely ignored. 6) Most of the justification for this answer is given above. Minor parties are allowed under the constitution, however they face serious legal and practical barriers to prevent them from ever making an impact on the political scene. Only two political parties are registered, both of which are controlled by Obiang. A report of the IBA Mission to Equatorial Guinea in 2002 noted that there was no visable opposition, and that there was the bear minimum of political pluralism. As such, any real opposition to the government regularly boycott elections which leave the playing field completely open for Obiang to firmly remain in power. In 2002, the European Union submitted a report condemning the recent election in Equatorial Guinea - specifically noting that '...the opposition was not represented in the elections in an appropriate way... opposition leaders remain convicted and in custody, or in exile.' 7) When Obiang was recently reelected as President, he reappointed the same cabinet ministers that had served under him for the best part of 20 years. Many of these were members of his own family, or members of the Fang ethnic minority. The main political tension in Equatorial Guinea, as reported by the BBC, is between Obiang's son Teodoro and members of the wider Nguema family who hold positions of power in the security forces and the military. It is this concentration of power amongst the ethnic Fang group and Nguema's family, in particular his son Teodoro, which justifies my answer. 8) All media is state owned apart from one small, private radio station - owned by the Presidents son. All journalists must be officially registered with the government and while freedom of the press is a constitutional right, there is high levels of government intervention and suppression of information. I decided to give a 0 for this question because in reality, there is no media allowed other than that which is controlled by the government or through the President's son. 9) IBA in their reports note that there is little adherence to the rule of law, and in particular this is evidenced by the severe lack of separation of powers of the state. The judiciary is furthermore unable to uphold any form of the rule of law because the courts are mired with corruption and are under the thumb of the government. In particular, the government partakes in acts of harassment which prevent the judiciary from functioning independently and therefore judges are too scared to uphold any form of justice. What is ironic is that the government in 2000 signed the Cotonou Agreement (a development treaty between the EU and other members of the African Union) which, in article 9 of the agreement, requires the upholding of the rule of law to be an integral element of sustainable development. Over the course of a decade leading up to 2009, the Equatoguinean government has consistency lapsed on its international commitments to the rule of law and justice. 10) The regime is not entirely totalitarian in completely banning political rallies or meetings, however there is heavy suppression. Political meetings are only allowed with the authorisation of the government beforehand, and face tight restrictions. Freedoms of association and assembly are suppressed, and the right to free speech and an independent media is spoilt through arbitrary arrests, torture by the President's soliders and detention. Nicholas Shaxson, a reporter for the BBC, details in his 2004 report into Equatorial Guinea 'Great Survivor' that individuals are brutally punished for engaging in their right of freedom of association and assembly. One political opponent to the regime described to Shaxson that the President's soldiers tortured him by cutting off his ears with scissors when he attempted to exercise his right to civil liberties. 11) IBA is most critical of the lack of an independent judiciary in their report 'Equatorial Guinea: At the Crossroads.' In their report they detail how it is clear how the government completely controls the judiciary. This is manifested in a number of ways: there is no separation between the Executive and the Judiciary, there is interference in the judicial system through political appointments by the government, and a prerequisite of 'loyalty to the government' for all judiciary clerks and officials. The judges act as military judges and wield military law over citizens to enforce the perceived power of the state. It is clear that the government has complete and unfettered power over nearly all elements of daily life. As such, it has been reported that there is virtually no civil society in Equatorial Guinea - there being a severe lack of basic societal cornerstones like libraries. The corruption and restriction of basic freedoms such as the freedom of speech and expression, as well as the endemic poverty, has stunted the growth of any civil society in Equatorial Guinea. Corruption is extremely pervasive and runs through all elements of life in Equatorial Guinea. Oil and petroleum exploration has resulted in an economic boom since the 1990's, however the President and other political elites have squandered the income from these reserves and crippled the economy. Civil society is stuck in a quagmire of corruption where nothing can be achieved without bribery or by nefarious means.",1,3,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,5,0,6,3,9
"Kyrgyzstan",2000,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Kyrgystan Start date : As democracy requires 'free and fair elections,' I've opted to study Kyrgyzstan from the year 2000, as in this year presidential elections were held which violated this criterion: according to infoplease.com, 'allegations of fraud' were levelled at that election; Britannica.com lends greater credibility in reporting that Akayev, the 'winner,'firstly breached the 'constitutional limit of two terms'by running as a candidate in this year, and secondly, obstacles were erected by the Akayev's administration in order to inhibit the running of his closest rival for president that year. Thus these corruptions of democratic standards represent a first step along the path to dictatorship. End date : 2010, as this was the year in which presidential power was curbed 'in favour of the prime minister' according to bbc.co.uk. Moreover 'multi-party coalitions' have governed since 2010; this implies that state power is both more diffuse and more representative of (popular) interests -this aligns with the general expectations held of democracy. According to Freedom House, the media still face a number of challenges; however, slow progress has begun to develop. Free and fair elections for executive and legislature : I have chosen one point for this question, that there is 'there are elections but a low likelihood for [government] change.'This is because in 2000 (see above) a free and fair executive transition should have occurred given that the limit on presidential tenure was up for Akayev -furthermore his rival for the post was obstructed. My judgment of one point is further supported by subsequent 'elections'throughout the period I have chosen: In 2005, elections were again branded illegitimate, and even met with 'violent protests,' according to infoplease.com and the bbc.co.uk, which led to Akayev absconding. From these underhanded tactics, and the popular responses, I infer that these elections were unfree and unfair; they involved Akayev attempting to minimise the chances for an executive transition. The 2007 elections were also branded illegitimate amid arguments that President Bakiyev had attempted to unduly strengthen his position in the run-up, firstly by passing controversial new powers, and secondly by firing his Prime Minister, who had been sourced from the opposition, according to infoplease.com. This trend of self-serving authoritarian practices continued through 2009 when Bakiyev attempted to further concentrate his power through reforms. BBC.co.uk confirms Bakiyev's 'struggle with parliament.' From Bakiyev's tactics I infer again that he, like his predecessor Akayev, was attempting to protect his executive power at the expense of rivals, and parliament (and thus legislature) . In these ways presidents Akayev and Bakiyev aimed to undermine democracy, and prevent transitions. Universal suffrage : according to cia.gov, Kyrgyzstan has universal suffrage as is conventionally understood, for those over 18 years of age. Effective opposition and possibility to be elected to govern : I have chosen two points for this question, that during the period 2000-10 in Kyrgyzstan 'there was an opposition, but [that] it had little potential to gain power.'I reach this conclusion as -given the data I cited and discussed in question four -presidents Akayev and Bakiyev worked to ensure that the (ir) opposition didn't assume power at their expense during their reigns; Akayev in 2000 by defying time limits on the presidential office and obstructing his rival candidate, and in 2005 by further protest over alleged corruption (infoplease.com and bbc.co.uk) ; Bakiyev in 2007 by tussling with parliament for more executive power, and arbitrarily dismissing the opposition-sourced Prime minister in the run-up to that year's election (infoplease.com) . Are all people able to access political power : for this question I answer with one point as, according to a Silk Road study, politics is a tussle between 'patronage networks' ; furthermore, presidents Akayev and Bakiyev of my period of study both came from 'ruling families.' Is there a free and effective media to hold power to account : I have chosen one point for this question, as, according to Freedom House, throughout the noughties the Kyrgyzstan press experienced 'censorship, self-censorship and government intervention.'State pressures imposed both self-censorship and real-world penalties via 'harassment' and 'prosecution.' 2001 saw a law passed rendering the incarceration of 'critical reporters' easier. Despite apparently promising developments in 2004 harassment still occurred, and the state maintained legal and financial means of squeezing critical outlets. Under Bakiyev 'free and effective media'didn't fare much better: his administration had a 'significant level of control over broadcast media,' and critical outlets were still under threat, even physical threat. In this way throughout the period I have selected Kyrgyzstan experienced an inhibition of independent media's ability 'to hold power to account.'-The data for this question is all sourced from Freedom House. Does it uphold rule of law : I infer from the above data that rule of law in Kyrgyzstan was somewhat subordinate to the whims of power-hungry elites during 2000-10. Furthermore recent EU-initiated programmes for the country imply an unsatisfactory record during this same period. Further, the judiciary was subject to the executive, as I mention below, according to Freedom House. Hence I answer the question with two points, insofar as the Kyrgyzstan's leaders over this period of study exercised significant degrees of control over the media and judiciary, institutions which would in theory have held them accountable for violations of the law. Do its citizens have human rights, including freedom of Assembly, Speech and Mobility: to extrapolate from the data I cited earlier regarding the media, I infer that any politically threatening free speech or assembly was repressed or contained throughout Kyrgyzstan during this period. More specifically, according to Freedom House notes that free assembly in Kyrgyzstan was only partially permitted. In consequence I answer this question with one point, as freedoms of expression that were of real consequence met with suppression, according to Freedom House reports, in the censorship of official media, and the crackdowns that occurred in response to popular demonstration. Such violent state repression of protests also implicates Kyrgyzstan's protection of basic human rights throughout this period. Free, independent, fair judiciary : Freedom House reports that Kyrgyzstan's judiciary lacked independence; that venality among Kyrgyz judges was reported, and that 'defendants'rights'were often neglected. In this way judicial fairness, freeness and independence are patently lacking, though it is implied that the judiciary is not always and completely corrupt; hence I answer this question with one point. Institutions to hold executive to account : I answer this question with two points as the power balance between parliament and the executive, as noted earlier, appeared to oscillate as new measures/bills are passed or imposed. As noted above, the media was repressed, and the judiciary was non-independent; hence, overall, firm checks on executive power were lacking. Equal treatment for minorities : I answer with two points for this question as ethnic tensions have existed for decades in Kyrgyzstan, as I inferred from the bbc.co.uk source; furthermore; to make an educated guess I read into notes on the UN Human Rights site on the deployment of Human rights advisers in 2007 that general problems of ill-treatment and discrimination exist for Kyrgyz citizens. More specifically, Freedom House reports that several ethnic minorities have alleged discrimination in 'employment and housing.' Confidence in answers : I have used a variety of credible sources, especially the BBC and Freedom House; these sources conveyed consistent and similar picture of Kyrgyzstan from 2000-10. How corrupt was Kyrgyzstan throughout this period : Freedom House claims that general corruption in Kyrgyzstan was 'pervasive,' in its entry for 2010; more specifically, nepotism was also cited in regards to Bakiyev. Freedom House notes that Kyrgyzstan ranked a miserable 162 nd out of 180 in 'Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index' 2009. As a result I answer with zero points for this question. Types of corruption : I answer this question by ticking 'bribe-taking'based upon a general inference regarding the 'pervasiveness' of corruption mentioned above; that is, given the well-established place of bribery as a means of corruption, and 'special privileges granted to politically-connected people'as per the nepotism referred to above.

"Netherlands",1989,2002,"""Not much corruption detected""","For questions 4 and 6 I relied on the information provided by Nohlen, Dieter, ed. Elections in Europe: A data handbook . Nomos Verlag-Ges., 2010. In which elections were described as being competitive and open, with multiple parties gaining and losing seats in the legislature. For question 5. Horstman, Raymond, and Jan W. Van Deth. Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies Data Source Book, 1971-1989 . Steinmetz Archive, 1993. Showed that since 1971 elections were open to both men and woman above the ages of 18. Question 7 was difficult to answer, as there is not much information to understand who can run for election. However the following website displayed a vast, diverse spectrum of political parties, many of which were either satirical parties, or parties that stood for absurd issues, therefore showing that almost anyone with any idea can run a political party for such an election. http://amsterdamshallowman.com/2015/03/the-dutch-elections-2015-what-expats-need-to-know.html Freedom house answered question 8 and 10 by rating the Netherlands freedom of the media as one of the best in the world. While also stating that elections in 1989 were free and democratic. And that people had some of the best freedoms and rights universally. Schmeets, Johannes Josephus Gerardus. 'International Election Observation and Assessment of Elections.' (2011) . Indirectly showed public approval for the judicial system of the Netherlands by stating that over 60% fully trusted the system, one of the highest percentages in the world. While 90% trusted the legal system to uphold the law. Question 12 was difficult in that a direct article displaying the checks and balances for political institutions in the Netherlands could not be found. However, the Dutch Political Systems in a Nutshell article, http://www.nimd.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/documents-T-the_dutch_political_system_2008.pdf, explained how the Netherlands has a constitutional monarchy, two houses, a legislature made up of multiple parties with no single majority, and a seperations of powers under the judiciary, executive and legislative institutions. Minority rights were not so easily understood in 1989, as there had not been a great increse in foreign immigration, therefore ethnic minority rights were not established until 1998, as well as sexual rights and protections. http://www.minorityrights.org/5246/netherlands/netherlands-overview.html Finally, questions 15 and 16 were answerable from http://country-corruption.findthedata.com/l/10/Netherlands which has consistantly placed the Netherlands in the top 10 for low corruption. In my opinion this is correct as the Netherlands has been universally noted on its merits for protecting the interests of its citizens without compromise or any form of corruption.",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,4,3,15,14,29

There are also some restrictions as to those who cannot vote, such as persons convicted for crimes or offences; persons deemed insane and committed to a facility. http://www.ipu.org/parline/reports/2193_B.htm Political Rights 3: It is evident that there is opposition for political parties in Madagascar as with the coup in 2009, opposition TV and radio were being turned off. This lead to violent protests and opposition leader Andry Rajoelina to call the president to resign. Although this may not be through the electoral system we can see that there are groups who support different parties. Political rights 4: Madagascar is a very poor state and so people may find it difficult to run for elections if they do not have the money/ connections. Political rights 5: As mentioned before there is free media but with the government able to turn off opposition media. Restrictions on the media may be imposed as the government does not agree with what is being reported. Also corruption may play a vital role in this as transparency international reports of 19% people believing that the media is corrupt/ extremely corrupt. http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013/country/?country=madagascar http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13864364 Civil liberties 1: Madagascar on the freedom house website scored a 4 with a 1 being best and 7 the worst we can see that Madagascar is in the middle of the rating. This indicates that there are violations of these liberties. It has been shown that Madagascar's suppression of media and opposition protests are acting against the liberties of the people. Civil liberties 2: As mentioned before during this period many liberties were taken from the opposition supporters. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2010/madagascar#.VV5V8_mSySp Civil liberties 3/4: Transparency international had reported that 89% of the respondents believed the judiciary was corrupt/ extremely corrupt which would indicate that there is not much belief in the system that is set up. Civil liberties 5: there does seem to be some equality in the rights of the minority groups but there is only small amounts of representation and in some cases no representation for minority groups in the National assembly. There are only two Chinese-Malagasy, six Muslims, and one Hindu and no Indo- Pakistanis which shows some if only little representation.",2,2,2,1,2,2,1,0,1,2,4,1,9,6,15
"Bolivia, Plurinational State of",2010,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","I chose these years at random because MAS has been in power since 2006 and the politics have not been changed dramtically between now and then. In hindsight I should have studied 2006-2015 because the election that has just happened in Bolivia might have shed some more insight into the MAS regime. According to the Bolivian Freedom house report (2010) [1], international observers have deemed Bolivian elections as 'free and fair' . However, 'free and fair'covers a lot of different dimensions. Human rights watch (2010) [2] states that in 2010 there was universal suffrage and New Internationalist [3] confirms that there has been universal suffrage since 1952 in Bolivia, although the US Human rights report (2010) highlights that many poor rural dwellers do not have access to the documentation required to vote [4] - there is no discrimination to inhibit voting. The elected government was/is the Movement Towards Socialism party (MAS) and the leading opposition party was/is the Progressive Plan for Bolivia (PPB), coming second in the 2009 elections. There is also a range of other opposition parties including Democratic Union, Green Party and Democratic Christina party. [5] There is a high chance of other parties gaining power as the constitution only allows for a party to remain in power for two consecutive 5-year terms [6] . However, Bolivia's constitutional court allowed Morales (MAS leader) to rule for a third term in the 2014 elections, because his first term predated the current constitution and it was therefore believed that his first term shouldn't count [7] . This shows that the law may be waived by the person in power, indicating the government's influence on the judiciary and unequal access to power between parties. Additionally, it has been said that Morales has misspent tax-payers money to fund his own campaign and instructed police to take down any campaigning from other parties such as billboards/signs. Opposition Mendina states that the whole electoral system is tainted to keep MAS in power, although citizens are chosen at random to count the votes on Election Day, indicating that there is no actual election fraud. [8] A question about election fraud may have been helpful in determining how democratic each country is. In regards to media and freedom of speech, Freedom house has characterised Bolivia's media as 'partly free.' Bolivia has a range of privately owned media companies, which are free to speak out against MAS and Morales. Many of these media outlets, especially newspapers feature opposition pieces rather than pro-government articles [9] . However, critics claim that the government encourages self-censorship. [10] Violent attacks against people who speak out against the government also lessened in 2010, but Morales still fought with the press. [11] An example of this is Morales stating 'the largest and the greatest opposition [to this government] are the journalists.' [12] Media that publish racist or discriminatory content can be heavily fined and some people claim that these provisions were so broad they could be used against government critics. [13] Additionally, a regulation was passed in 2013 that force media outlets to devote a section of their writing or radio/television time to the anti-trafficking agenda. One newspaper claimed that they already had to devote a large section to government content [14], signifying that the government can coerce private media. Human rights including the freedom of assembly, religion, and movement are generally upheld by the government. [15] The anti-discriminatory legislation described above works to protect people from discrimination based on race, sexual orientation etc. However, the extent to which these human rights are upheld are completely dependent on accountability to anyone who breaches them. While the state may respect human rights, they may not enforce this properly. There is an independent and impartial judiciary for civil matters and people are prosecuted for human rights abuses [16] . In 2010, a law was created to appoint 5 judges in the Supreme Court, selected by universal suffrage- decreasing biases towards the government. [17] There is an ombudsman that oversees the judiciary and writes reports of corruption and malpractice within the judiciary. They can resolve issues on human rights cases, which the government can enforce. A cabinet-level presidential appointee is empowered to investigate corruption at any level of the government [18] . However, these reports often resolve in impunity and immense corruption in the judiciary persists, with judicial enforcement often focused around opposition members, with the countries most prominent opposition politicians facing multiple charges. [19] Corruption is a huge problem in Bolivia. There are no limits to political donations and these are not transparent. Companies have to offer 'gifts'to civil servants to get things done. Corruption is apparent at the highest level of government with the 2009 scandal involving the state-owned hydrocarbon company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales de Bolivia (YPFB) . Corruption is present in the judiciary, the police, organized crime, public administration and natural resources. [20] The options in the test did not cover the broad range of corruption that was present in Bolivia. I found the question about minority groups quite difficult to answer because MAS stands for the rights of indigenous populations and Bolivia is has a large indigenous population who supports MAS [21] . I therefore found it difficult to identify who the minority group was.

"Argentina",2005,2010,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Political Rights: Question 1: Media and many non- governmental agencies have described the electoral process in Argentina as generally free and fair. The constitution of Argentina allows citizens to exercise their right to change governments in a peaceful manor, through the process of free and fair elections. Question 2: The practice of free and fair elections in Argentina is based on universal suffrage -the age is 18-70 years universal compulsory and optional for 16-17 years in national elections. Question 3: Human Rights Report by the U.S. Government in 2010 (referenced as HRR, 2010 from here) indicated that Political Parties generally operate without restriction Question 4: There does not seem to be any evidence to suggest that any one person is excluded from the political process in Argentina -However, I would assume that like many countries the opportunity could be hindered due to socio-economic aspects of someone's life, such as lack of accesses to further education or funding/connections to enter the political sphere. Question 5: HRR, 2010 indicates that media and independent media are generally respected by the government. However, many media outlets were privatised at the time and cases of media skewering due to political influences has occurred. 'Some media conglomerates used media as a tool to generate criticism of government policies, while certain pro-government outlets consistently ran stories supporting the government's critical line against specific media organizations and individuals.' (HHR, 2010) . The American Press Association released a statement claiming that the Argentinian government had conducted 'campaigns against the right to inform'and had attempted to 'damage the credibility of the media'. Civil Liberates: Question 1: Although it is maintained in Argentina that no one is above the rule of law. There have been some cases of questionable actions by government or high ranking officials and business men. Such as the high profile cases against former vice-president of Argentina, Amado Boudou who was accused of money laundering, illegal enrichment and influence peddling to prevent bankruptcy of certain companies. The follow up of these allegations lead to the removal of a presiding judge and resignation of a prosecutor, who later had criminal charges brought against him by Boudou himself. Question 2: The Argentinian constitutions assure that generally, access to fundamental human rights is upheld in the country. The right to participate in actions regarding human rights is generally respected by the government. Question 3: The judiciary's transparency is questionable in Argentina, political influence seems to play a role in the actions of the judiciary. Question 4: There is an independent and impartial judiciary for civil matters in Argentina, citizens have the right to bring about lawsuit to protect their human rights which is under the constitution. The government also has an Ombudsman office that publishes yearly reports of all the cases it receives annually. Prisoners in Argentina also have access to similar processes, HHR 2010 states 'Authorities permitted prisoners and detainees to submit complaints to judicial authorities without censorship' Question 5: Although there does not seem to be an overwhelming of issues facing minorities in Argentina. HHR 2010, notes that a book released claiming that in 2008-09, there were 16 ethnic minority groups that suffered from the effects of historical prejudice. This affected that group's socio-economic opportunities such as, job opportunities, education, and housing. They were also vulnerable to modern-day stereotypical prejudice based on physical appearances. Although the government or executives does not seem to have any direct impact on opportunities for minorities to enter executive or government roles, there is only one indigenous person to serve in the chamber. No other know, indigenous, racial or ethnic minorities have served in cabinet, the national legislature or Supreme Court. Sources: The U.S. Department of State -Human Rights Report 2010.

"Bhutan",2006,2015,"""Not much corruption detected""","For this case, I have elected to evaluate Bhutan based upon a timeframe of between 2006 and 2015. These dates correspond to the (contemporary) reign of King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the fifth King of Bhutan. King Khesar succeeded to power upon the abdication of his father, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, in 2006. King Singye was responsible for the transition of the Bhutanese government from that of an absolute monarchy, by which the King exercised supreme and ultimate authority, to that of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, by which executive authority was relegated to the largely democratic Council of Ministers. King Khesar is thus the first Bhutanese monarch under this new regime. This time frame was chosen in part due to a lack of substantiating evidence by which to evaluate the nature of the regime prior to the succession of King Khesar, but also to accommodate the transitional nature of King Singye's reign, under which the political and civil practices of the Kingdom were in the process of adapting to a new and democratized constitutional regime, and thus cannot be considered to reflect a period of time in which the social and political policies of the Kingdom were stable. Consequentially, this timeframe offers us a point of reference by which to evaluate the success of the Bhutanese government's efforts to conform to modern socio-political practices as standardized by the international community. In our classification of the Bhutanese regime, many of the answers given are based upon evidence sourced from various international reports (see links below), including those conducted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, and Amnesty International, as well as from the United States Department of State, which testify to the low level (or outright absence) of corruption, and which corroborate to the guarantee and general upholding of the rule of law and of constitutional human rights involving access to civil and political freedoms. Analysis of the Bhutanese constitution and of its political system expose a mostly free and fair electoral process, by which universal suffrage is afforded to citizens, and political parties are independent and may compete realistically for power; these facts are corroborated by international reports which indicate of the growth of the active number of political parties, as well as to a lack of electoral fraud in elections held during our timeframe. However, many answers were scored with a lower rating of 1 or 2 out of a possible 3 (with the lowest possible being 0) as a result of three predominant factors: the relatively poor and marginalized treatment of minority groups by the Bhutanese government, the practical restrictions imposed by the government upon the freedoms of religion, assembly, and speech, and the continued influence of the King in the judicial and legislative processes. We shall discuss each of these factors in turn. According to international reports, the treatment of minorities in Bhutan is considered to be poor. A Nepalese minority constitute a large portion of the Bhutanese population (a report by the University of Sydney indicates that Nepalese make up some 25% of the population) and are alleged to be subject to considerable discrimination and harassment, including in the obstruction of access to political processes by their continued denial of citizenship (as non-citizens are denied the right to vote, and Nepalese are denied the right to citizenship) . Religious minorities (including Hindu and Christian minorities) also reportedly face discrimination and harassment by authorities, and homosexuals are unrecognised under law and remain a cultural taboo (acts of sodomy are also punishable by imprisonment) . As a result of these reports, the question relating to the treatment of minority groups and to their effective access to political power has been given a lower rating, despite the relatively fair treatment of the majority. International reports and Bhutanese law also indicate that certain rights to religion, assembly, association, and speech, whilst guaranteed, are in practice violated or restricted by government policies. According to the constitution, Vajrayana Buddhism is the official state religion of Bhutan, and reports indicate that institutions belonging to this school receive considerable patronage by the government, including in the guarantee of financial subsidies and of political seats in parliament (10 seats in the National Assembly and 2 seats on the Royal Advisory Council are reserved for Buddhist monks) . The construction of non-Buddhist temples and the celebration of non-Buddhist festivals also require government approval, and this is reportedly sometimes arbitrarily obstructed by authorities. The freedoms of assembly, association, and speech are also reportedly limited by the government on occasion, as a result of the need for protests, trade unions, and non-government committees to seek government approval before being allowed to organize. The government may deny or revoke these rights on the basis of a perceived threat to national, political, and spiritual security, and in some cases, reports indicate that force and intimidation tactics have been used in an effort to prevent or halt demonstrations. Similarly, media, both independent and state-owned, is reported to come under occasional scrutiny should it seek to criticise either the King or the political system; although the media has generally been permitted to criticize other aspects of the government, as well as to discuss taboo subjects such as homosexuality, without censorship. Because reports indicate that civil rights are occasionally breached and the media occasionally censored, questions relating to the freedom of the media and to the guarantee and protection of human rights were given a scoring of 2. Finally, questions relating to the independence of the judiciary and to the effectiveness of political checks and balances were given a scoring of 2 as a result of the continued involvement of the King in judicial (as well as legislative) processes. Under Bhutanese law, the King retains the power to appoint a select number of members to the Council of Ministers, as well as to appoint members of the Supreme Court, and to amend legislation; although reports do not indicate that these powers have been misused in any way. Additionally, although the King is considered both sacrosanct and legally inviolable, provisions have been put in place which oblige the King to uphold the Bhutanese constitution, and which allow for parliament to initiate a forced abdication in the event that the King were to violate his constitutional obligations. However, despite this evidence of a system of checks and balances, the afore discussed reports which indicate that the government may arbitrarily censor opposition to the monarch and to the political system have resulted in a lower scoring in the questions relating to these matters.

"Iraq",1991,2003,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","The first country I was assigned for the Regime Classification exercise was Iraq, 1999. I chose the period of time from 1991, the year the Persian Gulf war began, upto 2003, when Saddam Hussein was removed from power. During this time Iraq was under considerable pressure from the international community, in particular the USA under president George H W Bush to cease conflict with Kuwait, and relinquish any nuclear and/or chemical weapons, and the 1999 Shia uprisings follwing the death of Mohammad Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr. Saddam Hussein was the leader of Ba'ath party in Iraq. The Ba'ath party assumed dominance of the Iraqi political system in 1968. Due to the extended period of time with which the Ba'ath party held governance it is a assumption that no free or fair elections were held in Iraq, both before and during the specified time frame of the study. The country advertises suffrage to all individuals over the age of 18. However as no elections are held, there is no opportunity for Iraqi citizens to vote. There were a number of groups within Iraq opposed to the Regime of Saddam Hussein. While religious opposition groups could appeal to Iraqis because of the secular nature of the Ba'athist government, they could not gain power through an election, they would would have to rely on a Coup to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime. Saddam coordinated the media and educational system to put heavy emphasis on Islamic identity. Religious academic institutions were opening up across the country, and Qu'ranic and Islamic studies were introduced into the curriculum at all school levels. A religious radio station, al-Qu'ran al-Karim Radio was set up to expand and promote Islam in Iraqi life . Media under Saddam Hussain's Ba'ath party was severely limited and strictly controlled by the state. There was one news network called Iraqi News Agency which functioned solely as a mouthpiece for the regime. Any media other than that under the purview of the government was barred. Satellite dishes were illegal. Although this may have been circumvented by some of Baghdad's elite, the fear of being turned in or found out made this an uncommon occurrence. The Ministry of Information was charged with control of the media during Saddam's rule. At this time, there were only five state-owned daily newspapers, one government TV channel, and four radio stations. Legislation was in place to assist in the control of the media by the state, and digressions were not tolerated. Expression was widely restricted, and there were no laws to protect journalists or media professionals. The top decision making body within the party was the Regional Command, in theory its members were responsible to the party congress, but in practice they led the party congress. The regional command also held considerable power over the National command. Religious freedom within the nation was allowed, but only as tool to gain support from the populace. During Saddam Husseins rule there were few processes in place for which citizens could hold the government accountable. There was also very little transparency with regards to government actions. Largely due to the fact that the Iraqi Ba'ath party was strongly affiliated with the Syrian counterpart, and decisions were made concurrently, at the narrow benefit of the party, rather than the wide benefit of the state. With regards to the classification questions, I am resonably confident with my assesment. Iraqi history and Saddam Hussein are two well known topics. However I found the question on universal suffrage difficult to answer as Iraq had not held a free and open election during this time frame, so those who could vote according to legislation were not provided with the opportunity to do so.

"Paraguay",1997,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Other""","For Paraguay, I used several sources. First off, I read several summarys of recent history. Then we examine recent reputable NGO reports on the subject, notably in this case the Freedom House Index summary of civil liberties and political rights. For data on elections, the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook was used, along with a summary of the electoral systems of Latin America provided by Georgetown University. Ensuring that descriptions of the electoral system matched from both sources means I consider electoral systems data as presented in questions 1-4 completley reliable. Discussing individual questions, question seven denotes that political power is available to most. I selected this option and points assignment to represent the fact that there is a signifigant socio-economic divide present in the country, and combined with corruption and systematic isolation makes it unlikley for a person of lower socio-economic standing to achieve real political power. Questions relating to the Judiciary proved the most difficult to choose, as although there is an independent judiciary, which has the capacity to conduct independent judicial reviews, several NGOs, notably Freedom House express concern at the level of corruption present in the judiciary, with FH noting that political pressures, though technically illegal, were quite common. Elections have only become 'free-and fair' in the more recent years, with the events that led to this forming the start of the study period. For this reason I decided to rate my confidence as 4/5, because although on the surface of research it appears these elections are free and fair, I am not confident that a sufficent sample size exists, with electoral terms being 5 years, and only two or three elections having taken place since the move to a more democratic system. Corruption is the most pressing issue in this country. To Directyly quote the Freedom House Index Assesment ' Corruption cases languish for years in the courts without resolution, and corruption often goes unpunished as judges favor the powerful and wealthy.'. This and other assesments are sufficent for me to conclude that there is signifigant systematic corruption, even if it does not frequently occur at the highest levels of goverment. Furthermore, I belive that this is sufficent example of minority groups facing barries to equality, with Freedom house noting that, while the constitution allows for equal rights and protections for indigenous persons, ' In practice, however, the indigenous population is unassimilated and neglected.' Although several summarys and other articles were read, the primary sources in establishing this data were: Freedom House: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/paraguay#.VV7dy0-eDRY Central Intelligence Agency:https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pa.html Georgetown University: http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Elecdata/systems.html Human Rights Watch, Assorted Articles: http://www.hrw.org/search/apachesolr_search/Paraguay",3,3,3,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,4,1,14,10,24
"Malawi",1964,1993,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","This period of study was chosen in order to evaluate the relatively stable regime under Dr. H. K. Banda in Malawi during this period. Banda's regime was considered repressive, a dictatorship, the most severe type of personal rule, a one-party, one-man system. According to Ihonvbere, Banda's Malawi was the most corrupt and repressive political system in Africa. I have found that reliable and relevant data was difficult to source. Websites such as Amnesty International, Transparency International and the Worldwide Governance Indicators did not supply data as far back as Banda's regime. Most academic sources were more focused on the transition from one-party to multi-party and thus only briefly described the regime. Some books based on Malawi, especially those who spent time in Malawi were extremely useful but were published in the 1970s and thus did not span the entire period of study. Some of the answers were more obvious than others. For example it was clear that Banda faced no opposition, but discovering whether there was universal suffrage was difficult. The 1961 and 1964 Constitutions included Universal Suffrage but data could not be found on suffrage in the 1966 Constitution. However, based on the MCP Women's League, I assumed that it had not changed and that there was universal adult suffrage. Any clear violations or large exclusions would have been obvious. Question 4 Elections after Malawi was declared a republic in 1966 were held every five years (or if the Assembly was dissolved), as stated in the new constitution. The process of electing the President was done in two stages. It involved the national electorate college selecting a candidate (who must of course be a member of the Malawi Congress Party) . A nation wide referendum would then be held, and if the candidate received a majority, they were elected. If they did not receive a majority, a new candidate was selected and another referendum would take place, until a candidate received a majority. There was no Vice-President. There were also Parliamentary elections. Despite the constitution outlining the electoral process, Banda become the President for Life in 1970 (written into the constitution), and Presidential elections were no longer necessary. Banda had the power to remove any MP from the Parliament. He could also chose the MCP candidate for each constituency, and as no opposition was allowed, they ran unopposed. Banda claimed that he dictated with consent ( Malawi News 1963, in A Monument to a Tyrant by Chirambo) . (Forster) Questions 5 There was universal suffrage until the 1966 constitution. MCP Women's league. The 1964 Constitution included universal adult suffrage (Pachai pg 244: Malawi: the history of the nation) Question 6 Under the Banda regime, Malawi was a one-party state, with only the Malawi Congress Party allowed according to the 1966 Constitution. Any form of opposition was suppressed and any dissenting ministers from within the party were removed. Security regulations against opposition included seven years in prison for consorting with 'rebels'or the death penalty for treason. (Williams) . Banda's regime has been described as a hegemony, (Chirambo), as there was absolutely no opposition or competition to become more powerful than Banda. As there was no opposition, there was no opportunity to be elected to govern, only those from within the MCP and selected by Banda could be given positions within the Assembly and Cabinet. (Williams) . Banda was known as 'Ngwazi'-the conqueror -from Ngoni praise poetry, as party of his political discourse. Any specks of opposition were based outside the country and had no hope of being elected. (Ihonvbere) . Venter claims that Malawi did not even qualify as a one-party state, it was in fact a one-man state. Question 7 Anyone hoping to compete in a parliamentary election had to be approved by Ngwazi, as well as a member of the MCP. Given that no one was able to oppose the idea of Banda, and had to follow his ideas, anyone in parliament did not have any real power in the one-man state. In fact it is said that the only thing the Malawi Parliament did was praise and glorify their leader. As Banda famously said in 1970 'We are here to govern, at least I am' . Question 8 According to Williams, Malawi had three main newspapers during the Banda regime (and no TV) . Two of these newspapers were owned and run by the MCP itself. Expatriates owned the third paper. It was subject to harassment from the government, had limited freedom to comment, and its workers could be detained or exported. If rumours were leaked to foreign journalists, the government would trace these back and charge or deport the person involved. Some reporters were sent to detention camps. In Septemeber 1973, it is suspected that the government took over all radio and press. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was disbanded. Banda passed a law stating that if anyone passed what he deemed false information, they would be given a life sentence. Question 9 Being a one-man state, Banda essentially had complete control over the state, and definitely did not uphold the rule of law. Many describe the his power as arbitrary, (Williams) as he was able to change the law without any difficulties or opposition. This including changing the constitution, such as in 1970 to make himself President for Life. Although data from programmes such as Worldwide Governance Indicators do not go back to the Banda regime, it is clear that he considered himself above the law. Banda would have dissidents assassinated. The Young Pioneers were used by Banda to suppress subversives and create terror. These groups were above the rule of law as they were able to use extreme violence (Banda by Short) without checks from the police or army. And as Banda said in 1965 of the Young Pioneers Amendment Bill, 'The Young Pioneers cannot be arrested by any policemen without my consent & If a Young Pioneer arrests anybody & and brings them to a police station, the police officer in charge of that station must not release them & if he does release them, he is committing a crime' (Williams 227) . Although Banda did not physically hurt these people himself, he gave the orders and encouraged it. Question 10 It is clear that there were many human rights violations in Malawi under the Banda regime. Particularly enforced were Freedom of Speech and Expression violations. Free speech was not permitted. Security regulation included seven years in prison for consorting with rebels and the death penalty for treason. There was no opportunity for dissent, and the Young Pioneers were there to enforce it. Harder to prove is Freedom of Assembly and Association. Banda created groups such as the MCP Women's League, but the opportunity for citizens to gather outside the MCP and talk freely was undoubtedly restricted. Freedom of Mobility does not appear restricted, although the MCP held all the power over land ownership, which would have restricted some mobility. Laws were passed forbidding women to wear short clothing, forbidding men from growing facial hair. Arrest without warrant and detention without charge were normal as was the seizure of property. (Chikaya Banda) . Defendants were denied the right to legal representation in court, and no right of appeal. Banda believed that lack of evidence is not proof of innocence. In 1992 when the Vice President of the United States visited, he said that unless human rights were improved in Malawi, donations would cease. Question 11 The 1966 Constitution stated that the President is both the head of state and government. Similar to what Banda claimed about democracy, he said that 'the judiciary in any country must reflect the aspirations, the desires, and the actual social, political and economic life of the people & we do things in our own way' . Banda wanted both the legislative and the judiciary to be under his control. In 1970 the Traditional Courts were given much greater powers. Members of the courts were chosen and dismissed by the government. A clear example of the judiciary not being independent is the Chilomoni murder case. Banda was unhappy with the acquittal and simply demanded that the accused not be released. The case was overruled. Question 12 None of the above appear to have existed during the Banda regime. No one but Banda had power and no one would be allowed to question him, without fear of deportation, imprisonment or death. In December 1972, he did say that if Parliament was not satisfied, it could undertake impeachment proceedings, but obviously nobody could. Question 13 Although there was some discrimination, African and non-African desires were reasonably well balanced. Banda wanted to create a new culture based on both Western and Malawi culture. Unfortunately he based this on tribal customs, which created resentment between some tribes. He used traditional vocabulary to attract natives, such as his title Ngwazi. A national language was declared in 1968 - ChiNyanja, renamed chiChewa after the Chewa people, this too created resentment from people who were not Chewa. The prinicipal language of the North was used less and created difficulties for those that did not speak chiChewa. Non-Africans and Africans in senior positions were the most excluded. Non-Africans were eventually withdrawn from politics during Africanization, (although this helped keep racial tensions out of politics and improved the situation) although many still had high ranking positions. Question 15 Corruption was rife in Banda's Malawi. According to Ihonvbere, Banda owned almost half the economy and it was the most corrupt regime in Africa. Intimidation, bribery and election fraud were the norm. In terms of public resources, it is claimed that the growth statistics for the period are bias. Large amounts of foreign aid and investment were donated into the economy, but the majority of the population remained in poverty. Banda owned media outlets and estates that were previously owned by Europeans. Those close to Banda benefited greatly while most of the population suffered without education, medical care or the ability to purchase simple goods. Question 16 From the research gathered, it is clear that bribe-taking, special privileges and misuse of public resources were common. However the threat of Banda and the regime was enough to suppress the people from the top down, and bribes were not necessary, as the population was aware of the power of Banda. It is unclear whether fraud was committed against the government, as many would not be willing to take the risk considering the possible outcomes. Banda could seize the property of any citizen, so although this is corrupt, it was not illegal for him to do so as he made it law.

"Bolivia, Plurinational State of",1995,2005,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Freedom House reports of 1999, 2002 & 2005 were used to inform my answers. The confidence in which these answers were given varies; to explain this further the Political Rights and Civil Liberties sections will be answered separately. POLITICAL RIGHTS Question Two of P.R. was the most straight-forward to answer. Does this country allow universal suffrage? A country report done by the Federal Research Division ( http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Bolivia.pdf ) stated that shortly after the National Revolutionary Movement came to power through the 1952 Revolution, that universal suffrage had been instituted in Bolivia, which ended literacy requirements and racial restriction that had previously limited voting rights. Although two questions, were slightly easy to answer and find literature to provide evidence surrounding the question, the answers provided did not offer a wider range of possibilities therefore the answers given did not fit the Bolivian case too well. Question One was answered with: 'Voting is free but opposition parties face some significant barriers to gaining via elections' as this fits the Bolivian case the best, but at the same time is not very suitable. According to Freedom House (2002) national elections are free and fair, and citizens do have the ability to change their governments. But as well as this, the answer does not consider corruption within voting. In the Bolivian case, U.S. government officials say there had been evidence in the 2002 elections that drug money had been used to buy favour of government officials, including that of police and military personnel (Freedom House, 2005) . Question Five is much like this, and was answered with: Independent media may exist, but there is heavy censorship, self-censorship or government intervention in editorial processes. Freedom House (2005) stated that the Media was 'partly free', as although the constitution provides for press freedom, the ongoing political crisis in the country, economic conditions, and restrictive libel laws continued to impact reporting in 2000. As the Bolivian code stated that individual's found guilty of insulting, defaming or slandering public officials for carrying out their duties may be sentenced up to two years in jail, with longer sentences involving higher up officials e.g. President. Some answers were difficult in finding whether the laws put in place, were actually done in practice. Such as the Question Three : 'Is there an effective opposition and is there a possibility for it to be elected to govern?' Although the 2002 Freedom House report states that the Bolivian Constitution guarantees the right for the organization of political parties, it is hard to measure if in actuality, this is enacted freely by citizens. This was much like Question Four : Do all people have effective access to political power? This answer was more of an educated guess based off literature on the bribery and suppression of rights towards some minorities. CIVIL LIBERTIES Question One: 'Does this regime uphold the rule of law' was difficult to answer. And was an educated guess based off the information gathered on the Presidents between 1995-2005, their aims to fight governmental and judicial corruption, Freedom House (2002) also noted that Quiroga was highly respected by the citizens for his firm anti-corruption stance. Although, the judicial corruption was an important example of how although there may have be laws in place to fight corruption, that leaders of the state still had broad immunity from prosecution. Question Two was answered with: Rights are generally upheld, but there is still minor suppression. Freedom House (2002, 2005) reports state that the Bolivian constitution guarantees free expression, freedom of religion, and the right to organize political parties, civic groups and labour unions. But also highlights, that freedom of speech is subject to some limitations. Again, the possible answers were limited, an option between 1point and 2point, would be more suitable for this case. Question Three was answered with: Does this country have a free, independent and fair judiciary? This was a confident answer. Freedom House (2002) reports as well as Transparency International reports on Bolivia, highlighted the corruption that was rife in the judiciary within the years of 1995-2005 (and the corruption that continues today) . Freedom House (2002) state that, the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, remains the weakest branch of government and is corrupt, inefficient and the object of intimidation by drug traffickers. The judicial council has suspended dozens of judges and fined or placed on probation hundreds more because of incompetence or unlawful delays of the legal process. Question Four : 'Does this country have effective processes in order to hold the governing regime accountable& ' This answer was an educated guess as it was quite difficult to find whether processes had some real effectiveness. Freedom House (2002) noted that in 2001 President Banzer announced proposals to reform the constitution in order to decentralize and broaden political participation, and to also create 'national dialogue'as a means of creating policy consensus between government, the opposition, and nongovernmental organizations. Government-sponsored as well as independent human rights organisations exist, and the congressional Human Rights Commission was active and frequently criticized the government. However, it is also important to note that rights activists and their families were often subjected to intimidation. Question Five: Was answered with 'There are legal and statutory rights, but there is active social and procedural discrimination and inequality towards groups or minorities& ' Based of Freedom House (2002) reports there are laws in place to ensure the rights of minorities although these may not be enacted by the citizens. The report highlighted that Indian territories were often neither legally defined nor protected, thus coca growers and timber thieves exploited Indian lands illegally, and as well as this, some Indians were kept as virtual slaves by rural employers. Bolivia formed the 1994 Popular Participation law, which granted legal recognition to more than 520 indigenous communities, this guaranteed respect for the integrity of native peoples. Whether this law is enacted is difficult to know for sure, Freedom House (2002) highlights that despite the observance of customary law by indigenous peoples that was common in rural areas, that in the remotest areas, the death penalty, forbidden by the constitution, is reportedly sometimes used against those who violate traditional laws or rules. The languages of the indigenous population were also officially recognized, but the 40 percent Spanish-speaking minority still dominated the political process.

"Fiji",2006,2015,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","The chosen time period given for Fiji is specific to the bloodless military coup in 2006 by Frank Bainimarama, through to the 2014 democratic elections in which he was elected the president of Fiji. However, much of the analysis is based on the democratic elections in 2014, while taking into account the nature of the Bainimarama regime since 2006 and its implications on the long promised 'democratic elections' . 'In 2006 Fiji endured its latest coup since independence in 1970. Promised elections for a new democratic government were deferred several times and finally settled for September 2014.' (Forum, 2014) Fiji's current political rights is moderate. Their political rights rating improved from 6 to 3 due to September general elections-the first since a 2006 coup-that were deemed free and fair. The democratic elections of 2014, according to Multinational Observers Group confirmed that the elections were free and fair. (House, 2015) I placed 2 for effective opposition, for the reason that prior to election, new candidates of parties had limited avenues to work with in comparison to Bainimarama who had total rule and authority for 7 years prior. The censorship of the media meant that Bainimarama used that to his advantage. 'Fiji does not have a free media, he says, with the government controlling TV, radio and newspaper outlets. 'He has media exposure which other parties don't -- they've complained but there's no action. He has used the advantages of incumbency to the hilt.'' (Hume, 2014) However, this may change as the years come, and the political avenues become extended for future candidates. The electoral process was open to everyone. Participation in the electoral process also encouraged, however when we take into account media censorship, this may limit the ability of a citizen to say more freely opinions of elections. This is particularly in the case if people offend Bainimarama's regime. This was also why I ranked them with a two. Prior to the democratic transition, civil liberties, to an extent were given on the condition that the regime was not threatened, insulted or offended. 'In January 2007, Bainimarama returned executive authority to former president Josefa Iloilo, a staunch Bainimarama supporter, who named Bainimarama the interim prime minister. Bainimarama also continued as the head of the military, and Iloilo granted him immunity. While the interim government undertook a number of reforms to address official corruption, public support for the coup quickly diminished when the government began intimidating its critics and suppressing the media through arrests and travel bans. Bainimarama also continued to ignore international appeals and pressure to return Fiji to civilian rule. The pledge for political reform lost credibility after the interim government cut wages in 2007 and 2008 for civil servants, but not cabinet members, and dismissals and appointments seemed largely a matter of opposition to or support for the interim government and Bainimarama.' (House, Fiji: 2010 Scores, 2010) Essentially, Bainimarama was able to uphold the law (his law) whenever it best suited his circumstances. Although, post-elections has seen the implementation of Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) . 'Since the election of the new parliament, political transparency has increased through measures such as live internet broadcast of the inaugural legislative session, parliamentary sittings open to the public, official asset disclosures, and published meeting notes. The national budget is now subject to meaningful legislative review and public analysis, and is also posted online.' (House, Fiji: 2015 Scores, 2015) In terms of discrimination, Bainimarama has made it an initiative of his to remove all racial divides within the political government. Furthermore, ensure equal opportunity for all races to be politically competitive. This has seen much improvement from the past racially-motivated political coups. However, there may be minorities who are discriminated against such as gay rights activists etc. In ending, Freedom House confirms that Fiji has improved in implementing a democratic society, in comparison from their 2010 study under Bainimarama's military rule. Despite this, we can never guarantee that a government of such history can eliminate all corruption. Bainimarama may still be inclined to take advantage of his power in secrecy. I felt that it was important to rank Fiji in the context of the 2014 election, that it will justify a possible transition from military coup to democracy without violence. Furthermore, the possible transition of a 'dictator'or militant leader to a democratic president. Bibliography: Forum, C. C. (2014) .

"Serbia",2009,2009,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","Concering the fourth question, it is neccesary to consider that Serbia had gone through several dramtic upheavals and changes. (The third question was also relatively easy to answer) . In the given time period, Novemeber 2009, Kosovo achieved at becoming independant from Serbia. It is also neccesary to consider that relations, at the best of times, between Serbia and Kosovo have been tetchy. Although departing from the question in mind, in general Serbian citizen's, to an extent have fair elections. Fifth question - This has been of of the easiet questions to answer. Like most modern states worldwide, Serbians are allowed to vote at 18, with an execption (those who are 16 and employed are allowed to vote) . Sixth question - This question has been one which has required a bit of research, in order to understand it fully. The New Serb Democracy (NOVA), formed in 2009, focused on a civic orientated system, which would gain appeal, and also considering it had a varied and collective party backgroud, it would pose as a good opponent for incumbency in Serbian goverment in that time period. Seventh question - using Freedom House as grounding resarch, it is seen that across every spectrum, Serbian citizens have access to politcal power to an extent. Hoooowever, although having this in pace, minorities such as foreigners, Bosniaks and so on are misrepresented in Serbian parliment, despite Serbia being relatively liberal. 8th question - Although finding evidence, this has been a vague question to research/answer - but it was seen that media in Serbia in this given time period was free and restricted . Despite goverment officials and parties making threats to media/journalists from the SRP of the highly publicised court case of war criminal Radovan Karadaic,,practises of media control have never been enforced. 9th question - Research, or the lack thereof, have made answering this question a little difficult. From the information i gathered, as stated previously, upheavals in Serbia would have in one way or another, affected politicians/government accountability (due to Kososvo becoming independant, resulting in what would be called a blow to Serbian power etc..) 10th question - Despite upheavals during that period, and a dated a legal structure, Serbian citizens lead comfortable lives, socially wise, and have access to all rights . 11th question - During this period, to some extents, goverment officals still held power over the judicial system - resulting in what could be easily called as corruptive influence, creating potential discord, when hose in judical power spoke out and those who actually did their job properly, without fear of external and government pressure. 12th question - Information and research asked of this question have, at the best been vague and elusive. It has been apparent that accountability in this context, is not a focal point. Also during this period, there is little evidence proving if Serbian politicians were held accountable for actions. Considering the major changes during this given time period, lack of judical excecution (Failure to arrest accused war criminal Ratko Mladic) and major bouts of violence, accountability and judical power were clearly not a top priority. 13th question - Due to political violence, refugges and minorities were abandoned and 'left in the dust:' in this time period. On the behalf of the Serbian goverment, they did not make the effort to eleveate or bring a basic change to minorities whilst they were in the process of sorting out domestic problems. This stance was also adopted by Serbian citizens, with the collective ostracization of Romany gypsies as well. 14th question - In general, i felt relatively confident with answering these questions. Initally, with my lack of Serbian politics, i was a little daunted, but during the research process, i felt and also found that i found a lot of relative and benifical information, not only for this assingment, but for my personal knowledge as well. 15th question - Considering all the previous statements, we may easily say that yes Serbia was a corrupt state. It is absoloutely neccesary to consider that Serbia wa shifting towards becomg a democratic (practicallly a more fair/equal) state. Cause and reaction can be applied here - cause being people were dissatisfied with life - the reaction being government officals negatively consolidated their power and soon. Protection ofrights were, of course, not a priority and also actions taken by the governemnt at that time, were widely criticised in the West and by Serbian citizens as well. As explained, it would be easy to describe Serbia as being corrupt, but in reality, it was going through a process of change. 16th question - Only small acts of corruption were enacted during this time period. The lack of judical and political acocountability, example being a minimal sentence of 30 days for accused war criminals etc.. CONCLUSION Small breaches of human rights / corruptive influences were evident in Serbia at this time. As previously stated, it would be pointless calling it a corrupt state. Rather it would be best described that it was in a period of change - shifiting from a archaic and rather persecutive (socially wise) system to a modern and effetive ssytem it is today. Most of the answered questions relied on this article (http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136056.htm) summarises human rights in Serbia in 2009.",2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,9,8,17
"Tanzania, United Republic of",2000,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Q4 - low likelihood of anyone expect the CCM gaining power because until 1992, Tanzania was a single party state. No one was allowed to compete with the CCM, and even though now multi-party elections are being implemented, corruption is rampant. Other parties do not have the resources that the CCM do - the ruling party uses money and other resources excessively to influence voters. The 'Traditional Hospitality Act,' introduced just before the 2000 elections, made it so that those competing for political posts could extend 'a vote of thanks' to their supporters - commonly called takrima - and it is extremely difficult to account for where the sources of money that many of these events held in the name of takrima came from. In 2010 there was widespread suspicion that the ruling party were working in tandem with electoral officials to change votes and ensure a CCM victory. ('In Re: Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://www.saflii.org/tz/cases/TZHC/2006/4.html ) ('Tanzania: Overview of Corruption and Anti-corruption,' acessed 21/02/2015, www.U4.no ) Q5 - universal suffrage (at the age of 18) has existed since 1958 when women were given the vote ('Women and the Vote,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/world-suffrage-timeline ) ('Feild listing: Suffrage,' accessed 21/05/2014, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html ) Q6 - Chadema ( Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo - Swahili for the Party for Democracy and Progress) and its allies (CUF, NLD and NCCR-Mageuzi) are gunning for a new federal structure that they have hopes will end some existing arrangements which help the CCM keep its grip on power. The four parties have decided to unite to provide a challenge to the CCM in the 2015 elections, but the assembly is drawing up a new constitution which fails to push the opposition's demand for this new system of federalism and thus will most likely help CCM keep a firm grip on power. ('Fractured Tanzania Opposition Unlikely to Unseat Ruling CCM Party,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/15100/fractured-tanzania-opposition-unlikely-to-unseat-ruling-ccm-party ) ('Zanzibar: Tanzania Opposition Party Calls for Protests after Rejection of Federalist Reform,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://unpo.org/article/17551 ) Q7 - the only justification i have for this is an educated guess. As far as I can tell, there is no restrictions on who can enter politics - for example Tanzania works hard to promote gender diversity. It is more a case of getting into power once you are a part of an opposition party that is hard due to the CCM's seemingly iron-clad grip on party rule. Q8 - the media in Tanzania is technically free - 'article 18 of the constitution safeguards the freedom of expression and the rights to seek, impart, and receive information on important societal issues and prominent people,' but self-censorship is encouraged and reporters are sometimes intimidated and threatened with violence. A law administered during the single-party era gives the government discretionary powers, and this was used to threaten some newspapers during the 2010 election over what the CCM saw to be unfavourable coverage. ('Countries at thwe Crossroads; Tanzania,' accessed 21/05/15, https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2012/tanzania#.VV2A6NLNu70 ) Q9 - The police force and the judiciary are considered the most corrupt institutions in Tanzania by the East Africa Bribery Index. Constitutionally all citizens are subject to the law and the judiciary is considered 'free and independant,' but since the judiciary does not have an independant bugdet and all judges are presidential appointees it is very difficult to say that it is free from corruption. ('Tanzanian Police the 'most corrupt' in East Africa,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://www.africareview.com/News/Report-says-Tanzanian-police-the-most-corrupt-in-East-Africa/-/979180/2051704/-/dc2egd/-/index.html ) ('East Afrian Bribery Index,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://soea.sidint.net/data/picture-of-now/east-africa-social-context/east-african-opinions-of-their-governments/ ) Q10 - freedom of association and assembly is guaranteed in the constitution, but the ruling party weilds considerable power with regards to moderation and suppression of their activities. Again, while the constitution guarantees of the freedoms of expression and speech, there is fairly heavy government suppression of those it perceives as being averse to their cause - for example in 2012 a reporter was killed by police after he questioned them about the arrest of a fellowe reporter; one junior officer was arrested but six others thought to be involved were not pursued. Freedom of association, assembly, speech and expression are ensured up to the point of opposing the ruling party. ('Freedom in the World: Tanzania,' accessed 21/05/2015, https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/tanzania#.VV1_cdLNu70 ) Q11 - as mentioned earlier the judiciary is heavily influenced by the executive by way of appointing judges, and bribery is a large part of its day-to-day functionality. Q12 - there doesnt seem to be a whole lot of checks and balances on power in Tanzania. The most I could find is the system of accountablity at the elctorate level, whereby MPs are accountable only in that the wish to be re-elected. There is a public ethics secretariat, but the position is all but superfluous as it is accountable to the president not to the parliament. ('United Republic of Tanzania President's Office - Ethics Secretariat,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://www.ethicssecretariat.go.tz/ ) Q13 - Tanzania is fairly good with relation to minorities as there seems to be little of the groups to begin with. The government on paper is committed to gender diversity which seems to measure up in real life when the male/female split in government is considered. The 2013 first draft of the new constitution for the Federation of the United Republic of Tanzania recognised minority hunter-gatherer groups for the first time since the Independance. ('Tanzania's forgotten minority groups win rights,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Tanzania-s-forgotten-minority-groups-win-rights-/-/2558/1876206/-/cc7pgv/-/index.html ) ('Tanzania: Women's repesentaion quotas,' accessed 21/05/2015, http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/tanzania-womens-representation-quotas ) Q14 - I'm fairly confident, it's hard to tell with Tanzania because while in theory and on paper they have a functioning constitutional democracy, there is so much corruption going on under the radar to take into account. Q15 - I would say - educated guess - that corruption is pervasive at all levels of the state (as indicated by the East India Bribery Index) right from the institution of takrima, to bribery in citizens' everyday lives to go about their business and get things done when interacting with government officials.",1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,0,3,4,0,9,7,16
"Georgia",1990,2012,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","The given Country of Georgia was plunged into civil war in 1993 as a consequence the internal turmoil of this period provided a context for the answers to the questions above. The questions concerning the political rights within Georgia were largely based on the findings of Freedom house with their 2003 report that ranked it as partly free and highlighted the dominance of Eduard Shevardnadze following the crushing of the Gamsakhurdia revolutionaries: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2003/georgia#.VV1SL_mqqko The political rights questions were largely educated guesses based on what little information there was on the electoral process, all of the presidents were democratically elected following the collapse of communism in 1990 within Georgia. The questions concerning access to political power and having an effective opposition are largely undermined by the dominance of one party that has the ability to assign people to the judiciary, legislature and executive. However the question concerning the freedom of the press as a check and balance to power was covered to an extent in the later years of the research period quite well by http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/georgia . The civil liberties Questions are that concern the rule of law and independence of the judiciary are portrayed as being heavily influenced by the president and the ruling party in that appointment and pressure is applied constantly according to Freedom house. The widespread corruption of the Judiciary and policing system has allowed the suppression of human rights and the persistent persecution of minority groups such as Chechnian, Abkhazian and Gamsakhurdia supporters. Transparency International's 2002 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Georgia 85/102 countries due to its endemic nature http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/cpi_2002/0/ .As well as this there has been a publication of recommendations by the OECD for Georgia with specific regulations and laws that should have been implemented to combat corruption as detailed in this report http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org.helicon.vuw.ac.nz/docserver/download/2805041e.pdf?expires=1432183542&id=id&accname=oid006392&checksum=5998EDC52CA564AF5F4013E401CE435A . The was some difficulty in translating the effect of Civil war into the given options within many of the questions, for example prior to the civil war the president was democratically elected yet military intervention resulted in widespread ethnic conflict, not to mention the interference of Russia within the internal politics and security of Georgia.",1,2,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,4,0,8,7,15
"Egypt",1981,2011,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","On February 2011, President Mubarak announced his resignation and handed over Egypt's government to the military that promised to work towards a transition to a new regime. It was clear that neither political institutions nor the economic policies met the aspirations of the masses of people in Egypt and the whole Middle East region, and that was answer for the reason why people marched down the streets and sparked a revolution. Security is a major task that should be performed by the state. Egypt has been under an official state of Emergency which provided police and security agencies with powers to get demonstrations prohibited, newspapers censored, personal communications monitored, people detained at from their will, defendants sent before special military courts to which there is no appeal and prisoners were being held indefinitely without charge. In this section, I am trying to justify my answers to the above seventeen questions, which includes the political rights and civil liberties under Mubarak's regime. My answers covered the period in Egypt between 1981 until February 2011 when the January revolution provoked. There are five basic issues regarding Egypt's political rights such as elections, universal suffrage, opposition parties, people's access to political power and finally the media status within this era. First, for elections and opposition parties, voting was free under this regime but the opposition parties usually face significant barriers to achieve power through elections. Under Mubarak authoritarian regime, political parties and interest groups allowed to be established but they kept under tight control. No parties allowed to be based on gender, ethnic origin or religion background. Egypt has multi-party system that was allowed by its constitution. However, the national Democratic Party was the only long time ruling party that dominated the political sphere up until the Egyptian revolution occurred. Under Mubarak, opposition parties have no chance of gaining power for example the Muslim brotherhood party that was the most popular opposition party was excluded from running in the elections. Additionally, the rigged elections of 2005 when Muabarak won six-year term in office with 88.6% of total vote is another brutal example to show how elections were not fair or independent. Mubarak opponent 'Ayman Nour' who established the 'El.Ghad party', after facing him in the presidential election, he was sentenced to five years in jail on forgery charges. Rights groups say Egyptian elections, which consistently reproduce NDP dominated parliaments, are routinely spoiled by fraud at the ballot box, a claim denied by the government, which has pledged to hold a fair vote (Aljazeera) . Thousands of requests were also rejected to monitor the vote and count. Therefore, despite the eligibility of giving votes and involving in elections, Mubarak authoritarian regime had strong influence upon elections to keep opposition parties away from the political involvement to protect their positions, and the reason why people were not encouraged to vote in these unfair election. Universal suffrage and the lack of people's access to political power are another problematic issue within this period. In Egypt every adult can vote and it allow the universal suffrage. Elections are normally held for the president and unicameral legislature. Suffrage is universal and also obligatory for all Egyptian citizens over 18 years and that did not change under Mubarak corrupted system. Additionally, those who fail to vote should pay a fine and sometimes get imprison. But in Egypt there are large percentages that considered eligible voters do not usually vote. This returns back to people's beliefs towards the regime that made them assure that their votes will not count, and the corrupted system always rigged the elections and change votes for their own advantage. Thus this could also be an example to show the decline of political participation within this period and why the majority of people do not have any access to political power under Mubarak's regime; power is concentrated within the ruling elites. Under Mubarak regime, there was a huge criticism for cracking down on the local media, freedom of speech and expression. Despite some little achievements, media including theatre, cinema or press become such bolder in getting close on any topics once it considered taboo such as issues linked to the government or criticism for the ruling party. There was a red line in the area of critiquing the president (Muabrak), and those who exposed themselves to such issue; they ended up tortured or jailed. For instance, In September 2007, several opposition journalists and editors were arrested for 'harming the public interest' by publishing articles, which a judge said, implied that the NDP was dictatorial (Aljazeera) . This shows why there was a partial right and heavy suppression and monitoring for citizens to express their opinion and criticise the current authoritarian regime. Media was the tool that served the regime's interest and anyone could critique their way of exploiting people usually face charges of incitement to violence such as 'Tawfiq Okasha' who is a television host, and has had his own channel but it was temporarily shut down for being accused of insulting the president (Khalil, 2015) (world time) . Moving to the second part, which is the Civil liberties under Mubarak regime and starting with 'Does the regime uphold the rule of law? Generally, the rule of law upheld, but notable and some breaches do occur. The rule of law necessitates that law is accessible and clear so citizens of a state are aware of the boundaries of the law, which they must obey. The rule of law also applies to government and guarantees certain basic rights such as (presumption of innocence until proven guilty, not to be arbitrarily detained without due process and right to fair trial in an independent court) . Also, all the executive and judicial organs of a state must uphold the rule of law because nobody is above the law. That has existed under Mubarak's ruling time, but still significant diversion exists. For example, the case of 'Khalid Said' the Egyptian guy who was tortured to death at the hands of police officers and became the symbol for many Egyptians who want to see their country free of brutality and ill treatment. Khalid was killed after he posted a video on the Internet of officers sharing spoils form a drug bust among them. The authorities after his death refused to reveal the truth, beside no investigation has done saying that his death because he swallowed 'Marjuana' . Therefore, despite his calls for mercy and asking them why they are doing this to and the rule of law, they continued their torture until he died, and became main reason behind the causes of the demonstration in 2011. I believe that the Egyptian judiciary is independent of political influences, but there are some pre revolutionary challenges. There are some hardships while performing its role, not only as judicial institution, but also as constitutional authority that work alongside with the executive and legislative sectors. These problems included in the process of recruiting new judges. This process has characterised by the idea of favouritism and nepotism instead of the fair and equal opportunities that based on merits. Another challenge was the 'slow justice' and inefficiency. For instance, there were nearly 20 million cases waiting adjudication, and at the same time the number of judges did not exceed 9,000. Another major problem is related to the independence of the judiciary from the executive branch. Such interference could be seen in the authority of the president to choose the heads of judicial institutions with no regard for the principle of seniority. The minister of justice has the power to be involved in the judiciary affairs and control its budget (Mideast) . In 2003, in 'Yahya al-Refai' one of the judges in his resignation revealed the methodical campaign to corrupt and divide the judges by the ministry of Justice. He talked about the handing out of bonuses to compliant judges while others struggle with their basic wages, and the requirement that judges provide the ministry with copies of civil and criminal suits against prominent officials. Since then, judges started to talk about the political interference and corruption in the judicial affairs ( Transparency International, 2007) . Therefore, I believe that under this period there was some challenges that stand in the way of Egypt's judiciary and now there are some efforts to improve its efficiency and to achieve full independence and to be a professional institution. Without a doubt Egypt ensure religious liberty and its free exercise to its nation. Although the country upholds some equal rights and equal treatment for some minority groups, there are a level of discrimination, repression and inequality. Egypt has a number of religious minorities living there and reached to ten per cent of its total population (minorityrights.org) . For example, the Muslim brotherhood was founded by 'Hassan al-Banna' in 1928 and considered as an Islamic, political and social movement was officially banned by Egypt's government. The regime exerted some attempts to suppress the organisation during its 30-year rule. Undoubtedly, such influence has its role in sparking the Egyptian revolution in 2011. Yet the experience of some Copts in the recent years under Mubarak has been struggle. Coptic Christianity is Egypt's largest religious minority. Despite their safety that was guaranteed under Mubarak, there is some level of violence against Copts that were cites. For example attacks on Churches including the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the bomb that killed 21, which is the latest assaults. People had bad experience and believed that Mubarak failed to provide them protection in their country, and many Copts took place in the streets during the mass demonstrations opposing Mubarak and his regime. Last point is the corruption and the misuse of Egypt public resources. I believe that under this regime there were no checks or balances. Under this regime, officials were free and not restricted and corruption was pervasive from the head of the government to low level government, and that was clear in the matter of the misuse of public resources. For instance, exporting the gas to Israel. There was a massive loss incurred in the course of Egypt's natural gas that was exported to Israel. Under such case, 'Sameh Fahmy' who was the minister of petroleum and other petroleum officials were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on charges related to the misappropriation of the public funds (Masr, 2015) . He was accused of signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Israeli government that paved the way for exporting gas to Israel for 15 years at low prices, which minimum limit did not exceed the cost of production and maximum limit was not even corresponding in the same size with the international prices. Thus, this is a clear example to illustrate how this regime was completely exploitative and corrupted especially in the sense of using the country's resources. Therefore, I can say that I am completely satisfied with my justifications, and believe that despite some advantages that Mubarak had given under his power, there are huge disadvantages and its most important cause was corruption, dictatorship and the full authority to the extent of tyranny and absolute repression in many times. This was shown in the Egyptian case and how people were struggling to achieve their human rights and civil liberties under Mubarak authoritarian regime. References: Auf, Y. (2013) .

"Central African Republic",1986,1993,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Question 4: After overthrowing David Dacko in a coup in 1981, Andre Kolingba suspended the constitution in the Central African Republic, ruling with a military junta until 1985. In 1986 (the beginning point to my research) he introduced a new constitution that was ratified by a nationwide referendum. He declared his membership in the one-party state Rassemblement Democratique Centrafricain (RDC) and formed a National Assembly, naming himself president for a period of six years. Though legislative elections were staged in July of 1987, Kolingba effectively held all executive and legislative power in the nation. He prohibited his two major opponents from participating (Abel Goumba and Ange-Felix Patasse) and the elections were only semi-free. Considering these significant limitations, it is fair to conclude that there was minimal likelihood of government change via the electoral process. Kalck, Pierre. Historical Dictionary of the Central African Republic. 3rd ed. Trans. Thomas O'Toole. Metuchen, N.J. & London: The Scarecrow Press, 2004. Question 5 Justification: Universal adult suffrage was a part of the constitution that was promulgated in 1981, however this was suspended in the coup later that year. In 1986 when the new constitution was introduced, universal suffrage was present. This meant that anyone over the age of 18 was able to vote. However, as a single-party system with ineffectual elections, no opposing parties, the abolishment of term restrictions and a set presidency of 6 years, it is important to acknowledge that the notion of 'universal suffrage' was somewhat erroneous. It was not until 1993, when Kolingba was officially voted out, that the peoples'right to vote was actually practiced and thus validated. Kalck, Pierre. Historical Dictionary of the Central African Republic. 3rd ed. Trans. Thomas O'Toole. Metuchen, N.J. & London: The Scarecrow Press, 2004. Question 6 Only in 1991 did President Kolingba announce the creation of a national commission to rewrite the constitution to provide for a multi-party system. Until then, all opposition was persecuted. Kolingba also drafted the constitution so that it abolished term restrictions, allowing him a set presidency of 6 years. Therefore, no opposition was enabled during this time period. Kalck, Pierre. Historical Dictionary of the Central African Republic. 3rd ed. Trans. Thomas O'Toole. Metuchen, N.J. & London: The Scarecrow Press, 2004. Question 7 The National Assembly under Kolingba was made up of 52 elected deputies. Kolingba explicitly favored a subgroup in society in regards to who was allowed access to this political power. He was from the Yakoma group, which is part of the Ngbandi ethnic group found on the banks of the Obangui river in the south who make up approximately 4% - 5% of the population. Upon gaining presidency, he initiated a tribally-based recruitment policy for his administration. Members of Yakoma were given all key positions in administration, and came to make up the majority of the military also. It is fair from these recruitments to say that only few people were granted access to political power, and these requirements were discriminatory, despite membership being voluntary. http://www.preventgenocide.org/prevent/news-monitor/2001june.htm Question 8 The nation's first daily newspaper, the state-run E Le Songo, began publication in 1986. Several private daily and weekly newspapers were published, some of which criticized the president and the government. The country's main publications include Le Novateur, Le Citoyen, and L'Echo de Centrafrique . However, the most important means of mass communication in the country -radio - was owned and controlled by the government, and still is today. Although independent media existed, the primary means of communication was not an adequate check and balance on power. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102152/Central-African-Republic/214025/The-arts-and-cultural-institutions Question 9 Kolingba concentrated all executive and legislature power unto himself. This is evident throughout the second phase of his regime, which was marked by all sorts of fierce social protest movements that were often simply met with repression. By May of 1990, thousands had marched and united to strike for government reform. The government publicly rejected the demands for a multi-party national congress, and between May and August, detained supporters of the resistance, effectively denying their basic right to peaceful protest. This sort of action is symptomatic of the state's longstanding failure to afford the civilian population protection and uphold the rule of law. Kolingba and his allies were effectively above the law, and exercised power in their own favour as opposed to adopting their policies to fit with the existing law. http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/car-6.htm Question 10 Human rights such as freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and expression and freedom of mobility were all heavily suppressed under Kolingba's government. The government implicated heavy prosecution toward any resistance. On 12 September 1990, the regime arrested twenty-three Coordinating Committee members, who were meeting at the house of Aristide Sokambi. They had gathered to organize a demonstration planned for 20 September. Police also arrested Timothee Malendoma who expressed sympathy with the Committee. The next month thousands of teachers and health workers went on strike for a pay raise. Another source states that they also demanded a multi-party governmental reform. The government refused to acknowledge the demands, because they claimed that the negotiation had not followed legal process. Kolingba refused the payrise, and the strike ended on 4 December. http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/car-6.htm Question 11 The president had wide powers, and the executive branch of government predominated over all legislative and judicial branches, effectively rendering the judiciary weak and strictly controlled. Kalck, Pierre. Historical Dictionary of the Central African Republic. 3rd ed. Trans. Thomas O'Toole. Metuchen, N.J. & London: The Scarecrow Press, 2004. Question 13 There was minimal information on the rights of minority groups, however it can be ascertained from the nature of Kolingba's rule that minimal attention was given to such priorities. Many of the questions were very difficult to answer and to garner information on, given there is little information on the CAR during this time, and also presumably because Africa has faced so much political turmoil Kolingba was probably pale in comparison. Some of my answers were educated guesses, hence my lack of academic justification. Some of the questions were also relatively similar or the same but just phrased differently.",1,3,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,3,0,6,2,8
"Ghana",2004,2008,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","When I was researching Ghana, I was given the year 2005 so I decided to conduct my research for the years 2004 through till 2008 as this was the two closest election years to my given date. The 2004 election was won by the incumbent President from the NPP party, with a register voter amount of 10,354,970 in a country of roughly 20.8 million shows a great deal of suffrage as you can expect a large portion of that public to be under 18, although not all over 18s would be registered. That's why I marker Suffrage the way I did because a similar percentage or registered voters was mirrored in the 2008 election. The incumbent government won by roughly 8% and continued to govern until the next election. In 2008 the election results saw the incumbent president step down already serving two terms then lose the election and successful hand over power to the opposition NDC party. This shows the opposition worked in Ghana as they were able to successfully able to have a transition of power between two opposing governments while remaining a stable country. Using the Interparlimentary Union website (IPU.org) I was able to discover this information as well as filling in the gaps by using the BBC reports covering the 2004 and 2008 elections in Ghana. They are a democratic government which is shown by the way the election process is conducted. Even in 2008 when there was a victory by a margin or less than 1%, both sides appealed to the courts claiming the other side in election fraud, with a fair judicial system at a high level they were able to determine neither side had committed fraud and the incumbent government accepted the result and allowed a change in the governing body. The freedom of the press is very real within Ghana, much like the freedom of expression and other civil liberties they're protected within the law. But there was still attempts to stifle the freedom of expression within the media. As shown on the Freedom house website, there has been examples of MPs looking to sue the press for libel, as well as the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation deciding to fire 4 journalists for their work in a Ghana airways news article. This brought forward questions as to the legitimacy of their freedom of press, something is also challenged by the lack of money invested in it, meaning there is often cases of corruption amongst the integrity of the journalist's stories. Even with low corruption rates (ranking 64th in 2012 on the Transparency international Corruption Perceptions index) they show low levels of corruption especially with business partnerships. This is prominent with government officials asking for favours so that they can conduct their business within Ghana. The governments from 2004 onwards have sought to fight against corruption like this, seeing some success but Ghana still experiences corrupt government employees. The final part of the investigation was on the civil liberties of Ghanaians. They have all their full rights protected in their law, with a freedom house ranking of 2 in both civil liberties and political freedom. The reason that they can be considered as only a 2 is because despite having equal representation under the law, they still have significant discrimination, especially against women in rural regions. With access to education and employment significantly lower in these regions, it can't be considered an equally free country despite the best intentions to uphold the law by the government.",3,2,3,2,2,3,3,1,2,2,3,1,12,11,23

This last website was very helpful since it highlighted the time period I had chose, http://www.coha.org/cuba-votes-as-fidel-castro-steps-down/ .

However, using my base knowledge about Cuba it was easy to note that Cuba is corrupt and the goverment is a dictatorship, that attempts a facade of somewhat western ideals to the international level.

"India",1999,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Are there free and fair elections for this state's executive and legislature? Albeit currently dominated by two major political parties (The Indian National Congress (INC) and the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ), many minor parties have emerged as coalition parties, particularly since 1996. This is due to strong regional parties becoming popular within their respective regions. Currently, the 2014 incumbent government led by the BJP needed the support of the National Democratic Alliance to obtain a simple majority and assume power. In the 2014 election the results were as follows for the six leading parties (in percentage of votes) : BJP -31%, INC - 19.31%, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam -3.27%, All India Trinamool Congress -3.84%, Shiv Sena -1.85%, Biju Janata Dal -1.71%. Sources ( http://eciresults.ap.nic.in/, http://www.ipu.org/pdf/publications/free&fair06-e.pdf ) 'The Article 326 of the Indian Constitution grants universal adult suffrage, according to which, every adult citizen is entitled to cast his/her vote in all state elections unless that citizen is 'convicted of certain criminal offences' or 'deemed unsound of mind.' As per this concept, the right to vote is not restricted by caste, race, sex, religion or financial status.' ( http://www.elections.in/political-corner/universal-adult-suffrage/ ) Since 1999 there has been four elections (elections are held every five years) and through this time, the BJP and INC have each served two terms. It is very possible for the Indian Government to change hands due to strong opposition.

All that is required is the payment of ten thousand rupees and the completion of an application form. ( http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/RegisterationPoliticalParties.aspx ) Although the Indian Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, there are exceptions and anything that 'threatens the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India, friendly relations with foreign states or public order' will be subject to censorship. (http://www.telegraphindia.com/1111207/jsp/nation/story_14848886.jsp#.VV6emfmqqko) However, India was ranked 136 th in the world within their Press freedom Index ( https://index.rsf.org/#!/index-details/IND ) and were described as 'Partly Free' by Freedom House. There are laws in place that deliberately restrict what the media can report on: 'The sedition law, formally Section 124A of the 1860 penal code, outlaws expression that can cause 'hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection' toward the government. The 1923 Official Secrets Act provides authorities with the right to censor security-related articles and prosecute members of the press. ' ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2014/india#.VV6jLvmqqkp ) The Rule of Law applies to the Indian Government. In India, all are subject to the same treatment under their laws and the government nor its officials and servants are immune or exempt from this. 'The Judiciary, under the Rule of Law system, like the system in India, is empowered to apply the same law to a government official, as is the case with a private citizen. The Rule of Law being the basis of treatment of private and official citizens in India, the equality of legal personalities of all citizens is an important basis of dispensing justice in India' . (Hoveyda, A. (2011) . Indian Government And Politics. Pearson Education India.) Many fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech, mobility and expression are upheld in India however, India struggles to quash many violations such as torture, discrimination against the LGBT community and women and continuing to censor media. It is hard to give this question one of the four choices as it does not fit neatly in any. I felt that number two was the best as rights are generally upheld however I feel that there is more than just 'Minor' suppression of rights. This belief is perpetuated when events such as the criminalisation of homosexuality was reinstated in 2013. The Indian government perpetuates how imperative it is for the judiciary to be an independent organ of the justice system. 'The Constitution of India secures justice to all its citizens apart from securing liberty, equality, and promoting fraternity. Indian democracy the Supreme Court plays important role of safe­guarding the fundamental rights of citizens which includes provid­ing fair justice also. Justice which is the soul of a democratic society must be administered without fear or favor. Integrity, Impartiality and Intelligence are some of the important characteristics of the in dependent judiciary in a democratic setup. ' ( http://www.preservearticles.com/201103034384/essay-on-indian-judiciary-system.html ) . Private and official citizens are able to be judged in a court of justice without fear of corruption or political influence. Within the Indian Government, there ae three separate branches which are used to as checks and balances against the powerful central government. Similar to many other ex colonies, it is set up in a manner similar to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. There is an Executive branch which is led by the president, a legislative branch and a judicial branch. Each acts to ensure that that each branch is acting in a way that is in accordance to their constitution and in a way that assures a democratic process. ( http://www.india-in-your-home.com/india-government.html ) It is interesting as India boasts that 'The Indian Constitution ensures 'justice, social, economic and political' to all citizens. ' However, the LGBT community suffers great discrimination as there are no legal protections for their employment or things such as hate speech. There are also many articles within their constitution that aim to protect minorities however, there has been a lot of religious and gender specific aggression that has not been dealt with appropriately by the Indian government. It is my educated guess that this is more for show rather than practice. Corruption appears to be rife throughout the Indian Government, with bribery and extortion being a common practice within institutions such as the police force. 'Under the PCA, bribery is punishable by a fine and up to five years imprisonment. But many analysts believe India's sprawling bureaucracy and weak institutions-the police and judiciary were ranked as the second and third most corrupt institutions in India, respectively, after political parties-have thwarted convictions, and arguably increased incentives for bribery. In recent years, graft pervaded society from small-scale 'harassment bribes' (payments for essential social services) to scandals on a national level. At least 42 percent of young Indians have paid a bribe, according to a 2012 Hindustan survey. ' ( http://www.cfr.org/corruption-and-bribery/governance-india-corruption/p31823 ) As said before, corruption is rife and has been concentrated in many acts, particularly bribery.",3,3,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,1,3,0,13,12,25

To answer these questions, I looked at the political history in Cambodia, with a particular focus on the parties that currently sit in their government, and how votes were split. I found some of thrse questions difficult to answer, as not every citizen is able to vote in this country, not because the system is unfair, but because they don't know the full poulation, and many people aren't able to vote, as they are not registered. Also, the legitimacy of the voters themselves is questionable.

"Egypt",1990,2011,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Other""","Egypt from 1990 to 2011 was a debately corrupt led Government. Honsi Mubarak became President in 1981, following assassination of the previous President, and continued to rule up until 2011, following the Egyption Revolution. International non-governmental organizations (E.g. Amnesty International) repeatedly criticized his administration's human rights stats. However, Egypt was continued to be called a 'Republic'. There was substantial and accurate concerns regaring political censorship, police brutality, arbitrary detention, torture and heavy restrictions towards freedoms of speech, association and assembly. According to Freedom House, Egypt's 2004 score for 'freedom' was a 6 out a rating of 1 = best 7 = worst. Egypt's score of civil liberties was also a 6, and so was the political rights of the country. Looking specifically at the time period between 1990 to 2011, Egypt was a heavily controlled and corrupt Government, seen from the world outside. Political reform was extremly difficuly during this period. Previous to 2005, opposition candidates were not allowed to run for Presidency, extremely limiting change to the political society. The elections were exclusively held for the rich and politically influenced. Eqypt has an Emergency Law, and from 1967 has continued to exist. This Emergency Law allows police and their power to be much more than previously. Constitutional rights were suspended and censorship (of all kinds) was legalized. This consequenetly meant that non-governmental political activity such as street demonstrations, or non-approved political gorups or organisations. The numbers of people arrested over this law is up to 17,000, and political prisioners of the country run as high as 30,000. Critisism of the President in media could be punishable by fines or prison sentences. Journalists faced harrassment, and media platforms felt heavily influenced and pressured to write certain information over other. Egypt has universal sufferage. During this period (1990 to 2011) there was little opposition - with the regime winning elections with 88%+ every time, both Presidential and legislature elections. In 2011 ABC reported the personal wealth of Hosni Mubarak and his family was in excess of $70 million funded by bribery and corruption. Only Mubarak and his immediate family were given the keys of power and influence at the top of the Egyptian. Freedom of the press is limited - the government owns and operates all television stations and newspapers. Certain radio stations are private but must report to the government regime in order to receive their broadcasting liscences.

All independent rights are heavily suppressed - any political gathering, meeting or rallies must achieve government approval beforehand via the Minister ofthe Interior. Mosques are the most common site for Egyptian muslims to meet en mass, and the government controls all Mosques. Sermons are dictated and monitored by the state.",1,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,5,1,7,7,14
"Angola",1992,2002,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","I examined the period of Angolan history from 1992-2002. I chose this period because it was the second Angolan civil war, between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) . This caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and many displaced persons. I considered extending the research period out to 1975, when Angola gained independence and the first civil war started, but the fact that the two remain separate in academic literature led me to the conclusion that focus on the second would provide more cohesive data. The source I used for this was ' Angola: Second civil war (1992-2002) ' by EISA. When determining if Angola had free and fair elections, I used the source 'Angola: 1992 Election Results and Aftermath'as well as ' Angola: Second civil war (1992-2002) ', both by EISA. Angola only had one election in the period examined, in 1992. This election was supervised by the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, and was deemed to be free and fair by the international community. There were instances of irregularities, but the mission ascribed these to the inexperience of the electoral system more than any perversion of figures by state officials. In the 1992 election there was 92% voter turnout, as shown in ' Angola: Second civil war (1992-2002) '. This is a good indicator that there is universal suffrage in the country. In the 1992 election, there was significant opposition to the winning party, MPLA, in the form of UNITA. In the presidential election, leaders respectively gained 49.7% and 40% of the vote, whilst in the parliamentary election the numbers were 54% and 34%. As the elections were free and fair, it can be reasonably assumed that the opposition to the MPLA was very strong and had a good chance of winning power through election. This information came from 'Angola: 1992 Election Results and Aftermath'. I struggled to find information on how many people have access to political power. From what I could find out, to rise to power in this period meant falling in with either MPLA or UNITA. The two parties appointed their own leaders, who had historical ties to the party. The fact that the two figures of Jonas Savimbi and José dos Santos dominated the two parties for the entire period, and the death of Savimbi ended the civil war makes it difficult to ascertain how power moved around, as it did not move at all. However, the ability of many parties and people to contest the 1992 election, despite having very mediocre success compared to the two major parties, indicates that whilst unlikely to result in a power shift, other people could at least contest in elections. This information came from 'Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola'and 'UNITA'by Britannica, as well as 'Angola: 1992 Election Results and Aftermath'. Angola did have some independent media, but most of it was state owned. However, there were heavy controls over how independent media operated. Defamation cases would be brought against those criticising people in power, coverage of the civil war was outlawed, and many newspapers began self-censorship to avoid lawsuits. This information came from 'Jose Eduardo dos Santos: Angola's shy president'by Louise Redvers of BBC. Concerning rule of law, I was torn on whether to give Angola 1 or 2 points. In the constitution, any member of the government can be prosecuted, even the president provided it is after his term has ended. However, severe problems with the justice system, such as a lack of lawyers and low access to the courts means this has little effect in practice, and crimes from bribery to rape go unpunished in government forces. This information came from the KAF Democracy Report 2006 and the 1999 Freedom House entry for Angola. There is a lack of fundamental human rights in Angola. From controls on freedom of the press, limitations on freedom of association, a lack of access to the courts, forceful recruitment of minors into the army and many other breaches, Angola has a poor record on this front. Thin information came from Freedom house and the KAF report. On the issue of independent judiciaries, officially the courts were independent during the second civil war. However, a lack of adequate pay for judges, as well as very limited access to courts meant that in reality this system was actually susceptible to corruption. This information is in the KAF report. During the civil war there was no system by which to hold the government accountable. There were no government bodies, such as an upper house, to check power, and decision making was often left solely to the president. Courts officially were able to prosecute government -however, access to courts, lawyers, and funding for such cases was never a real possibility for citizens. In the period following the civil war, this problem was addressed with an ombudsman being appointed, but before this there was no way to hold the governing regime accountable. This is from the KAF report. I struggled to determine how minority groups were treated during the civil war. However 'Angola Overview'by World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples helped me. The government made efforts to include all ethnic groups in the army, and had radio broadcasts in all major languages. However, disparity arising from oil and diamond trade labour conditions meant that many ethnic groups in the central regions of the country suffered during the civil war. In fact, a lack of human rights and due process was an affliction of the entire country. So in reality, minority groups were not treated well in Angola. Almost no groups were. I am confident in my answers, as the evidence I have seen is all corrobatory, proving the claims I make. Corruption in Angola is an interesting question. During 1997-2001, $1.7 billion US went missing from state accounts. There is evidence of patronage and clientelism, supplemented by thinly veiled bribes to companies owned by government officials. President dos Santos would regularly roate officals, putting his own supporters into power. Through the military, war crimes and bribery were rife during the civil war. There were many extra-judicial executions as well. Blood diamond trade and corrupt influence over the oil industry are also rife. All of this led to the conclusion that Angola is an extremely corrupt state. Information on this came from 'Angola's Political and Economic Development'by Council for Foreign Relations, 'Angola country profile -Overview'by BBC and the KAF report.

"Chile",1990,2004,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Regime Period My reference year to study is 2003, and the period I chose as my regime parameter in Chile is from 1990-2004, which encompasses a period of minimal significant political change, in-between Pinochet's Dictatorship, and fully functioning democracy. A policy paper published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies titled 'Road to Development' focuses on the period between 1990-2005 as a period in between regimes, which reinforces my reasoning. 1990, is what some determine the completion of Chile's transition to democracy, marked by the election of Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin in December 1989. Prior to this, Augusto Pinochet ruled under a military dictatorship from 1973. Pinochet introduced a new constitution in 1980 in order to initiate a democratic transition, in which he expected to be reelected. I have selected 2004 as my end date, due to the 50 extensive Constitution reforms conducted by President Ricardo Lagos in 2005, which saw to a removal from the Senate of 9 appointed seats, 4 representatives of the armed forces and also lifetime positions for former presidents, as well as reducing the presidential term (from 6 years down to 4) . Lagos controversially classified 2005 as marking Chile's full transition to democracy. I can understand his reasoning, as the period prior to this represents most elements of a stable democratic regime; however aspects of Pinochet's 1980 constitution and the nature of the democracy he intended left remnants of his brutal dictatorship yet to be reformed. Political Rights As introduced in Pinochet's 1980 constitution, Chile has a binomial electoral system. Under this system, a candidate needs a 50% majority +1 to avoid a run off election. Two candidates are elected in each district, which results in an over-representation of the second majority list. This excludes the voice of minority parties, as it makes it harder for one bloc to get the upper hand. In 'Road to Development' Arturo Valenzuela claims this system to be flawed democracy, as it doesn't singly elect the candidate with the most votes. This system does grant Universal Suffrage; men and women aged 18 and over were eligible to vote. However, due to major inequality issues, 41% of the population did not partake in elections prior to 2005. A 2004 National socio-economic survey suggested the presence of an overall income gap of 33%. The Road to Development report suggested this means women cannot fully participate in the system. Accountability While Chile technically had an independent and reformed judiciary that promoted the rule of law, over this period, the Chilean government struggled to alter the existing rules in the Code of Military Justice in order to reform its judicial branch. The constitution meant that 10 of 17 Supreme Court Judges were those appointed during Pinochet's regime; which made actually conducting reforms highly difficult. Faced with a history of unprosecuted war crimes, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was introduced to address this in 1990, and its resultant report was released in February 1991 which identified 3,428 cases of disappearance. In order to address this, the report recommended the strengthening of civilian authority in Chile's society and judiciary system. The Military Code gave military tribunals jurisdiction over crimes committed by military personnel; basically meaning the judge and victim for war crimes under Pinochet's rule was one in the same. Pinochet was eventually arrested, under Lagos, however he died before conviction; his immunity through the constitution made the prosecution very difficult. There was a continual struggle with the civil-military divide. However, despite this, the Congress and Executive worked together through a network of linkages to track the government agenda through ministries and committees in congress, in order to bring light to these issues and deal with them accordingly. Civil Liberties The 1980 constitution encompassed a greater protection of Human Rights, and therefore these were generally upheld. However, discrepancies were reported in regard to Freedom of Assembly and Freedom of Speech. While the Government often permitted protests, there were frequent cases reporting police brutality and management. Freedom House's 1998 Report referred to a case where the police force dealt with protesters via the use of water cannons and tear gas in order to forcibly detain protestors. Human rights violations were reported over this period in regard to land ownership of minority groups. Native American groups, particularly the Mapuchas were vocal about their rights to ancestral lands. This was something that Alywin and Lagos Administrations Addressed; the Indigenous Law was promulgated in 1993, Aylwin developed a Special Commission of Indigenous People, however this didn't bring about any significant changes to accommodate the needs of minorities. Freedom of Speech and Expression also appeared be considerably suppressed in regard to the press. Technically speaking, there was independent media present during this time, however the ownership of media companies was highly concentrated; 95% of all print media was owned by two companies, of which both were the sole recipients of government subsidies; indicating media from these companies did not have a broad research base, and government subsidiaries provide an incentive to produce content to their liking. The press was an area that received very little reform following 1990, and according to an article released by Reporters Without Borders, there has never been a legal framework to ensure a fair distribution of frequencies among different types of broadcast media. Consequently, the State Security Law and 1984 Anti-Terrorist Laws had not been amended from Pinochet's 1980 constitution, and were frequently reported to be used against journalists who investigated the dictatorship. A press law reform was implemented in 2001, which did remove certain provisions on Article 6b of the State Security Law, however other amendments were made, such as the restriction of a journalist's right to report on a person's private life; prosecution for this act could now take place under the Penal Code, which continued to occur. Between 1995-2005, a stud by the Office of Special Rapporteur for freedom of expression on murder of journalists and media workers between 1995-2005 concluded that Chile had tighter press restrictions than any other Latin American country, apart from Cuba (The Economist, 'Chile Unfree' ) . In regard to Corruption as the private misuse of public resources, there were very limited reports of corruption amongst the top governing elite from what I could research across this period. The 'Road to Development 'panelists underscored the importance of transparency and good governance made the state effective between 1990-2005. Transparency international ranked Chile to be the least corrupt country in Latin America in 2003. However, Freedom House identified corruption amongst lower ranked officials to be a relatively common occurrence. In 2003, police peddling, insider trading and a report of kickbacks resulted in the Head of the Central Bank and two cabinet members leaving their job. Dozens of lower-ranked officials and several members of congress from the ruling coalition were indicted in this particular incidence. Research Evaluation In regard to research, I found it quite difficult to find specific details and information, especially in regard to question 12, whereby I had to make somewhat of an educated guess based on the general knowledge I had gained about the regime. I found some of my research didn't fit entirely with the options given, considering the complications Pinochet's Constitution had left on some aspects of the regime, which was not a direction followed by Governments after 1990 (in regard to question 11 in particular) . I found the Freedom House website to be very useful as a starting point for my research as it provided a broad overview concerning most issues relevant to my research, broken down by year. The only issue I encountered was their research didn't extend earlier than 1998. Another source of particular value was a policy paper published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies titled 'Road to Development', which helped me to identify my regime period of study. This is a compilation of presentations from different political science and economic experts identifying elements of government that helped and hindered development leading up to 2005. Also, I found an article titled 'The Dirty Legal War- Human Rights and the Rule of Law in Chile from the Tulsa Journal of Comparative and International Law to be particularly helpful as it identified possible issues associated with the judiciary in regard to the military. I did find a discrepancy of information between Freedom House and an article published in the Economist in 2001 on Free Speech; Freedom house stating it to be widely free, while the economist article claimed it to have tighter legal restrictions than any other Latin American country in regard to the press, which indicates perhaps Freedom House's broad brush approach to issues isn't the most accurate research base.

After being elected in 2002 the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) government attempted to make reforms trying to stop corruption and setting up independent human rights agencies. However infighting between different factions over power collapsed the coalition and caused the reforms to be abandoned. They began securing power for the leaders. Ethnic elites close to Kibaki abandoned the reforms. The political environment was then manipulated to secure power, they changed the constitutional review process and preferred a constitution that 'favoured their desire to secure a hold on power.'

However there is a degree of self censorship by the media. Ron Singer writes 'press suppression and violence against journalists represent fairly isolated events in recent Kenyan history.' Singer continues that the main limitations in Kenyan media come from corruption and an ethnic bias towards Kikuyu. Kikuyu being the largest ethnic group in Kenya in 2009 with over 6,622,576 or 16.9% of the population. President Mwai Kibaki is also an ethnic Kikuyu.

Human Rights in Kenya are in place via the constitution however the government sometimes represses these rights. In terms of Freedom of Assembly, The US Department of State 2009 report on Kenya claims that 'the constitution and law provide for freedom of assembly, but the government frequently restricted this right in practice. Organizers must notify local police in advance of public meetings.' Similarly Freedom of Association is monitored by authorities. The Kenyan societies act states 'Every society which is not a registered society or an exempted society is an unlawful society.'

"Guinea",1993,2007,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Question 4: Following a decade of a military dictatorship, multi-party presidential elections were held in Guinea for the first time in 1993. Lansana Conté, who had been leader of the military dictatorship, was elected president with 51.7% of the vote. However, his win was tarnished by claims of tampering by his opponents and concerns over a general lack of government transparency. These claims were strengthened by the Supreme Court's invalidation of the votes in the Kankan and Siguiri prefectures, two regions were Conté had won over 90% of the vote. During the next presidential election in 1998, Conté's period of authoritarian rule continued as he again won the election with 56.1% of the vote. Although there were fewer concerns regarding fraud than the 1993 result, many opponents and outsiders were still apprehensive over the legitimacy of the result. Two days after the 1998 presidential elections Alpha Condé, a prominent political opponent of Conté and future president, was arrested for attempting to illegally leave Guinea. Conté's last election before his death in 2008 was in 2003 and was the most notably unfair of Guinea's presidential elections. The election was boycotted by Conté's main rivals over concerns of voter manipulation, resulting in a landslide victory for Conté with 95.6% of the vote. Voter turnout was estimated by the opposition party to be as low as 15%, and shortly after the election an opposition spokesman was arrested for criticising Conté's win in a radio interview. This research shows that while Guinea underwent a formal constitutional change in 1990 in an attempt to legitimise a democratic government, there were still major concerns regarding the fairness, transparency, and legitimacy of the election results. Elections were often marred by occasional violence, political protests, and the intermittent arrests of political dissidents. For this reason, I have stated that while there are indeed elections for the executive and legislature of Guinea, between 1993 and 2007 there was a very low likelihood of a change in government. Question 5: According to the CIA World Factbook, Guinea has universal suffrage for citizens over 18 years of age, which is guaranteed in the Article 2 of the 1990 Constitution. However, according to a Freedom House report, there are many societal practices that discriminate against women and constitutionally protected rights are often unrealised. Political participation is also divided primarily among ethnic groups. However, there is little evidence to suggest that suffrage is actively denied to people based on gender or ethnicity. Question 6: Opposition parties are allowed in law and several exist. However, during this period there was a major lack of credible opposition, and Conté was strongly backed by governmental institutions and media. Combined with this was a significant neglect of the constitution and rule of law as many of Conté's political opponents were harassed and even arrested. This clearly shows that while political opposition was allowed to exist in Guinea during this period, there were significant barriers stemming from the incumbent to allow a change in regime. Question 7: According to Article 10 of the 1990 Constitution 'All citizens have the right to form associations and societies to collectively exercise their rights and their political, economic, social or cultural activities.' Despite this, power was centred in the hands of Conté and his small collection of followers, and access to such power is strongly limited by corruption, nepotism and ethnic biases. Question 8: A 1998 Freedom House analysis of Guinea's freedom of the press shows that there were many significant barriers to a free media. All broadcasting, including the country's only newspaper, was state-owned and offered little criticism of government policy. The government was permitted under various laws to censor and supress speech critical of the president, or speech that 'disturbs the peace' . The small amount of independent media that existed and offered any dissention was routinely harassed by the government and was heavily censored. The political persecution of dissenting media, combined with extensive state control over the major media outlets resulted in the nearly complete absence of a free press to act as a check on power. Question 9: President Conté retained a large amount of political power and was able to use his influence to subvert the rule of law as well as retaining decree power that could completely undermine the parliamentary process. The rule of law was routinely breached to harass and actively persecute political opponents. A State Security Court was established in 1997, which was permitted to operate in secret with verdicts that were not allowed to be repealed. Arbitrary arrests were common and prisoners were often subjected to torture and poor treatment by authorities. Question 10: An array of civil liberties including the freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and the freedom of mobility were outlined in the Guinean Constitution. However, in practice these civil liberties were rarely respected by the government, which passed laws allowing for the suppression of speech, and also giving powers the ability to ban any assembly that threatened 'national unity' . Question 11: While by law the judiciary is independent, in reality the judicial system is plagued by extensive corruption, nepotism, and political interference. This judiciary was considerably underfunded and suffered from a lack of resources and trained experts. Question 12: The only supposed check on the powers of the executive came from the judicial branch, which under law was nominally independent. However, this judiciary was subject to a significant amount of political interference. The primary check on government power came in the form of elections, however as mentioned earlier these were often highly corrupt and subject to fraud and voter suppression. Question 13: Discrimination towards minorities was forbidden in the constitution, yet in reality there was active social discrimination towards minority groups, in particular women. A 2003 report by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour revealed that at one local hospital more than 20% of female patients were there as a result of sexual violence. Despite its illegality, a Demographic and Health survey determined that 96% of women had been subjected to female genital mutilation. Combined with this, Guinea had and continues to have no legal protections for homosexuals and homosexuality was actively punished by law. Ethnic tensions were substantial, and during elections racial rhetoric featured prominently, in some cases even resulting in violence. Question 14: I am confident in the sources of my research and my ability to answer the questions wholly and accurately. Freedom House provided a wide range of years of reports that I was able to use to collect information from over the time period. Question 15: According to Transparency International, Guinea is currently in the bottom 8 th percentile for control of corruption and is ranked 145/175 on the Corruption Perceptions Index. During the regime of Lansana Conté, high levels of corruption were a fixture of government activity. Guinea's justice system during this time was notoriously corrupt and suffered from a complete lack of independence between the government and the judiciary. Public funds were often used in the persecution and arbitrary arrests of Conté's political opponents. This level of corruption is not just limited to the highest levels of the executive branch and public officials often took bribes in exchange for various public services including water, electricity and health care. An investigation by the FBI also determined that government employees had taken bribes in exchange for the mining rights to Simandou, an extremely rich undeveloped mineral deposit. Question 16: The most common instances of corruption during this period were the complete lack of transparency around the government's use of public resources and large amounts of bribe-taking by public officials. Drug traffickers also took advantage of Guinea's poorly-run justice system and according to Guinean law professor Barry Saifoulayue traffickers often bought impunity from the law.",1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,4,0,7,4,11
"Yemen",1998,2002,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","For the following responses, I will be outlining the research that enabled me to come to the conclusions that I did in regards to regime and corruption classification in Yemen around 2000. I will separate the explanations to each question by an indentation in the paragraph and the number of the question that it is referring to and the subsequent point that was allocated to the country for the question. I will follow this with the resources used to answer each of the questions. I chose the date range of 1998-2002 for the focus of my study because it encompassed the 1999 Yemen Presidential Election and allowed for studies about the reinstated governance of President Saleh to be formed. 4) 1 point: The reason that I chose to apply 1 point to the question of free and fair elections in Yemen is based through Freedom House Reports. As expressed by Freedom House, the Presidential elections of 1999 were not free nor fair. The party in power at the time blocked the only main opposition that was participating in the election who, it is seen, had their campaign financed by the pre-existing government. Freedom House expresses this election as 'more a referendum than an election' and I think that the lack of a credible opposition strongly points towards the elections being pre-determined. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko &gt;) 5) 2 points: It is expressed by Freedom House that the relevant 1999 Yemen Presidential Election was based on universal suffrage and those above the age of 18 were able to vote upon registration. This is agreed upon by Human Rights Watch, although they question the monitoring of voter registration and election monitoring. An issue in the culmination of my data for this question is that I have found no research that outlines the ability of women to vote in elections and I believe that this would be key to the changing of my point allocation. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko & http://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/yemen-bck-0201.htm ) 6) 1 point: Yemen was ruled by President Ali Abdullah Saleh at the time of focus for this study. As mentioned before, the only key opposition party to Saleh's was banned from participating in the 1999 Presidential Elections. This points to the presence of opposition but the lack of opportunity for this opposition to gain any power. An APS Review in 2002 highlighted a referendum passed in 2001 that allowed Saleh to have the power to dissolve parliament, leaving himself as the sole leader. This further expresses the notion that although opposition may exist, they have little potential to gain power because Saleh is also willing to restrict the gaining of power to the people below him in his own government. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko & http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&docType=Article&prodId=AONE&tabID=T004&searchId=R2&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&contentSegment=&currentPosition=1&searchResultsType=SingleTab&inPS=true&userGroupName=vuw&docId=GALE%7CA89370799&contentSet=GALE%7CA89370799 ) 7) 1 point: Both Freedom House Reports and APS Reviews on Yemen point to the members of government being chosen by a small group of leaders, notably the President. Freedom House states that the ability of citizens to change the government is restricted by the concentration of political power in the hands of a small group. APS Reviews shows that in late 2000, Saleh enhanced his political position by replacing many civilian and military figures with younger ones that would be more loyal to him. This included his son Ahmad Ali and numerous 'half-brothers.' As is common in technocratic regimes, Saleh surrounded himself with loyal relatives that he believed could be trusted. This is why I chose to place Yemen at 1 point for this question, the information seemed unquestionable. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko & http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&docType=Article&prodId=AONE&tabID=T004&searchId=R2&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&contentSegment=&currentPosition=1&searchResultsType=SingleTab&inPS=true&userGroupName=vuw&docId=GALE%7CA89370799&contentSet=GALE%7CA89370799 ) 8) 1 point: Information gathered from Freedom House and Human Rights Watch regarding Freedom of the Press in Yemen is what formed my answer to this question. If independent media is allowed and attempts to act as a check or balance on power then they are frequently arrested and tried in Court on the basis of defamation charges. Human Rights Watch highlights that in 2000, defamation suits were placed against at least seven opposition and independent papers, one opposition paper was suspended for more than a year during this. Article 103 of the Press and Publications Law 25/1990 of Yemen legislature outlaws criticism of the head of state and anything that spreads word against the Yemen state is illegal. These constraints restrict the reliability of media produced in Yemen and diminish the ability of the media to highlight the truths of what is occurring in Yemen. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko & http://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/yemen-bck-0201.htm ) 9) 0 points: I found it difficult to find information in direct relation to this question so my answer is somewhat an educated guess. This is based off information from Freedom House which quotes an Amnesty International report that stated that torture, disappearance and arbitrary detention frequently occur in Yemen. The same report states that the government has failed to investigate hundreds of disappearances since the late 1960s and although not directly stating that leaders of the state are not subject to the rule of law, I think that it is fairly clear that leaders would not be unless it was in direct insult of President Saleh. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko ) 10) 1 point: Although technically allowed the fundamental human rights of Freedom of Assembly and Association, Freedom of Speech and Expression and Freedom of Mobility, people living in Yemen can only do so under strict observation of the government. Freedom House reports that permits are required for public gatherings which are monitored by government informers, workers unions are allowed although government personnel are often placed in influential positions within these and permission to strike must be obtained from the union federation which is controlled by the government. Independent organizations must register with the government and face harassment and arrest. Human Rights Watch documents that in May 2000, six activists were charged with 'disrupting public order by calling a demonstration and dispersing material critical of Yemeni unity.' The extent of the control is widespread but tries to hide under the guise of conforming to human rights. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko & http://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/yemen-bck-0201.htm ) 11) 0 points: Freedom House clearly states that the Yemen judiciary is not independent and judges are frequently poorly trained and susceptible to bribery and government influence. The government is reluctant to carry out sentences and courts are governed by Sharia in which there are no jury trials. The lack of jury trials and the susceptibility of judges to be influenced by the government points to the immense lack of an independent or free judiciary. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko ) 12) 0 points: The power of the government in Yemen rests in the authority of the president who has the authority to rule by decree and override decisions put forward by parliament. As stated previously, an APS review on Yemen in 2002 shows that a constitutional amendment has given the president the ability to dissolve parliament without any other consent. This obviously negates the accountability of the government as the president can override anything put towards parliament. It seems to me that the existence of a parliament in Yemen is an attempt to promote and conform to 'democratic ideals'but with the overriding capabilities of the president, it is misinformed. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko & http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&docType=Article&prodId=AONE&tabID=T004&searchId=R2&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&contentSegment=&currentPosition=1&searchResultsType=SingleTab&inPS=true&userGroupName=vuw&docId=GALE%7CA89370799&contentSet=GALE%7CA89370799 ) 13) 0 points: It is reported by Freedom House that minority groups are not held equal with the majority of society in Yemen. Followers of religions other than Islam (which makes up about 99% of the country) are allowed to worship freely but are unable to try and convert others to their religions nor are they able to construct new places of worship without permits. Women also face harsh restrictions and discrimination. Those convicted of 'moral offenses' can be detained for indefinite periods under the penal code and 'honour killings' still take place, although the number of such cannot be determined for lack of investigation or reports. These examples point to the government being the institution that restricts minorities the most and are the ones that enforce (either by submission or direct action) this discrimination. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2001/yemen#.VVvXLvmqqko ) 15) 0 points: My response to this question was a relatively educated guess and I found it difficult to find resources pointing to the private misuse of public resources in Yemen although I'm fairly certain that it would have occurred. The overriding power of President Saleh and those he surrounds himself with and the continued lack of a good standard of living for the majority living in Yemen points towards corruption through the redistribution of public resources towards private benefit. 16) Bribe-taking by public officials: Middle East News Online highlighted in an article in 2002 that favouritism plays a key role in recruitment of government officials and bribes and corruption remain a major obstacle for the effectiveness of the government. Special privileges granted to politically-connected people: An APS Review on Yemen in 2002 shows that companies such as Hunt, Nexen and TotalFinaElf who had the ability to get in direct contact with President Saleh were much more successful than others.

The timeframe chosen (1991-1999) represents the period of democratic rule under Boris Yeltsin in his title of the first President of the Russian Federation. Q4. As Yeltsin was elected through democratic election as an establishment of Russia's first democracy, and dissolution of the Soviet Union, this was the first example of a free and fair election in the years of 1991-1999. An example of a rapid legislature change was Yeltsin's rise to power, going from a communist state to a democratically functioning country. In the 1996 election, with the growing popularity of the Communist Party, the legislature and executive could very easily have been dramatically converted back to Soviet-style policy, government, and way of living. -Yeltsin's Russia and the West . Andrew Felkay, 2002. USA: Praeger Publishers Q5. Universal suffrage was first established in Russia under Soviet rule in 1918; an update to this constitutional agreement was during the reign of Stalin in 1936, where the voting age was lowered to 18. These was no change in this constitutional right, from when it was first initiated, through the 1991-1999 period examined. -1991: Autocracy and Dictatorship . Stephen J. Lee, 2006. USA & Canada: Routledge -CIA World Factbook: Russia. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html Q6. During Yeltsin's second term campaign, his popularity had widely diminished (due to failed privatisation attempts and a falling economy; speculated as more detrimental than the Great Depression of the 1930s) . A nationalist communist rival party had risen in status ('Russian Communist Party') since Yeltsin's first term, led by Gennady Zyuganov. Through massive efforts in campaigning and realistically unattainable promises made by Yeltsin, the election was exceedingly close; the former president achieving a 53% victory over his left-wing rival, claiming 40.4% of the popular vote. This is an example of an opposition party seizing the potential opportunity to overthrow the current regime. -Washington Post (Foreign Service) . Lee Hockstader, July 5 th 1996. Q7. Under the amended constitution of the Russian Federation of 1993, every citizen has the right to form political groups, and any citizen can register a party within the official governmental elections (held every four years between 1991 and 1999) . Article 36 supports this, stating: 1. Citizens of the Russian Federation shall have the right to participate in managing state affairs both directly and through their representatives; and 2. Citizens of the Russian Federation shall have the right to elect and be elected to state bodies of power and local self-government bodies, and also to participate in referenda. -Russian Ministry of Justice. minjust.ru/nko/gosreg/partii/spisok -Federation of Russia - Constitution, 1993. http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-02.htm Q8. Only several years prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the policy of Glasnost ('Openness/Freedom of Speech' ) was introduced. This condition allowed the news media and press more opportunities to critique leaders and inform the public of governmental decisions (eventually opening the eyes of the oppressed under the communist regime, and assisting the fall of the Soviet Union) . When Yeltsin took charge of the country, he took it as his democratic duty to abolish remaining censorship laws of the media. This contributes to the overall freedom of the media, but there were several instances in which the media demonstrated 'forced loyalty'to the government. An example of these times was the compliance in not revealing the extent of Yeltsin's health issues to the public. 'Even with the media's elite bias towards Yeltsin, the flow of information and advocacy& was quite large and diverse.' -Yeltsin: A Life . Timothy Colton, 2008. USA: Basic Books -NY Times. Marilyn Berger, 2007. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/world/europe/24yeltsin.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& Q9. By the Russian constitution, government elites are subject to law, and can be held accountable (with consequence) for misconduct. Article 93 is relevant to the consequences of major political transgression, stating: '1. The President of the Russian Federation may be impeached by the Council of the Federation only on the basis of the charges of high treason or another grave crime, advanced by the State Duma and confirmed by the conclusion of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, on the presence of the elements of crime in the actions of the President of the Russian Federation, and by the conclusion of the Constitution Court of the Russian Federation, confirming that the rules of advancing the charges were observed.' An example of a breach of this law was the Boris Berezovsky case; a rising oligarch during Yeltsin's reign, who was charged with embezzlement and fraud in 2000, but was accused of committing these crimes while Yeltsin still reigned. The lack of jurisdictive consequence, and his association with Yeltsin's inner circle, gave critiques room to criticise the degree of validity in the former President's regime. -Federation of Russia - Constitution, 1993. http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-02.htm -Boris Berezovsky -Wikipedia. -'The Yeltsin Family Took Bribes.' Philip Willan, 1999. The Guardian. http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/26/russia.philipwillan Q10. Civil liberties including freedoms of expression (Art. 29), assembly (Art. 31), education (Art. 43), free trial (Art. 19, 49), and religion (Art. 28) were all guaranteed under the 1993 amendment of the Russian constitution. There were no outstanding instances during this time period (that I came across) in which these liberties were violated by government personnel, or any cases in which a particular liberty was oppressed. -Federation of Russia - Constitution, 1993. http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-02.htm Q11. According to the Russian constitution, the judicial system is free and independent: Article 120 'Judges shall be independent and submit only to the Constitution and the federal law' ; and Article 124 'The courts shall be financed only from the federal budget, and the possibility of the complete and independent administration of justice shall be ensured in keeping with the requirements of federal law.' Throughout Yeltsin's reign, this was kept relatively close to the guidelines. An article of concern however, which could allow for the impact of political influence is Article 128, stating '1. The judges of the Constitution Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, the Higher Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation shall be appointed by the Council of the Federation upon the proposals by the President of the Russian Federation . 2. Judges of other federal courts shall be appointed by the President of the Russian Federation according to the rules fixed by the federal law.' With selection process of the country's judicial system so heavily reliant on the word of the president, there leaves a potentiality for this democratic function to lose credibility through potential influence and bribery/corruption. I did not find any severe examples of a democratic breach of this condition, however the room for error was allowed by fine print, and there undoubtedly would have been instances in which this concept was taken advantage of. -Federation of Russia - Constitution, 1993. http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-02.htm Q12. In 1994, after years of promise on the updates of human right mandates, an official ombudsman was established in the Federation of Russia. An example in which this role contributed to the success of Russian democracy under Boris Yeltsin was the counsel provided during the President's deployment of military force in Chechnya (beginning the First Chechnya War, 1994) . Without this intervention, and the pressure to call for ceasefire with Russia's neighbour, the death-toll for both Russia and Chechnya's forces would have increased dramatically, and would have lost Yeltsin even more favour from his people. -Politics Russia .

USA & Canada:Routledge -World Affairs Board: First Chechnya War -1994-1996. http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/showthread.php?t=1965 Q13. The rights of minorities are ensured by the Russian constitution under Article 19: '2. The State shall guarantee the equality of rights and freedoms of man and citizen, regardless of sex, race, nationality, language, origin, property and official status, place of residence, religion, convictions, membership of public associations, and also of other circumstances. All forms of limitations of human rights on social, racial, national, linguistic or religious grounds shall be banned. ' I could find no outstanding evidence that signalled any controversial/game-changing disregard for the rights of minority groups between the years of 1991-1999, such as mass oppression, genocide, or mass appeals by the Russian people for inequality. Minority groups are issued universal suffrage under the 1993 constitution also, (technically) granting political and social equality. -Federation of Russia - Constitution, 1993. http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-02.htm Q14. I am relatively confident with the answers provided as the information used to make conclusions on the political nature of Russia during 1991-1999, was recorded just over twenty years ago, so research material was exceedingly difficult to come by. I do signal small doubt in my answers however, as do to the rocky nature of the recently-dissembled communist country, it was hard to gauge (through media and literary accounts) the successfulness of early democratic functions, and to evaluate their potential likelihood to succeed in such a broken country. Q15. & Q16. Boris Yeltsin's regime was relatively sparse of corruption, but there are certain instances when government behaviour communicated otherwise. The rise of the oligarchs in Yeltsin's Russia was considered an example of corruption, where a small number of wealthy elites (some members of Yeltsin's inner circle, such as the infamous Boris Berezorsky) took advantage of the privatisation scheme projected by the President during 1992-1994, and made millions through the exploitation of the 'voucher privatisation' system; many accredited this new accumulation of wealth among few to Yeltsin himself (this was also considered a misuse of public resources as the voucher system was offered to the citizens of Russia, and was exploited by those in close connection with the president) . A secondary instance in which Yeltsin and his government were associated with bribery and corruption claims, was the alleged credit card scandal of 1999, in which millions of dollars were being funnelled into secret renovations of the Kremlin and the reparation of the Moscow Parliament (post-Yeltsin's shelling saga of 1993), in the name of Yeltsin (and his two daughters) on various credit cards. -'The Yeltsin Family Took Bribes.'

"Malawi",1995,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Political Rights Q1: Are there free and fair elections for this state's executive and legislature? (3 possible points) Voting is free and there is the potential for opposition to be elected however, given the high number of independant elected polititions, averaging around 35, the power of collective opposition is severly decreased. Also the ability of the current government to use public media oulets creates an unfair advantage. The elections are far from transperent preventing Malawi from gaining three poitns and the potential for regime change is slighty higher than the qualifiers for a single point, leaving 2 points as the remainig result. Q2: Does this country allow universal suffrage? (3 possible points) Adults over the age of 18 can vote provided they are a mentally conpitant citizens and not under death sentence administed by the judicary or previously convicted of a voting related offence. As not every adult can vote, two points is the maximum allocation. Q3: Is there an effective opposition and is there a possibility for it to be elected to govern? (3 possible points) There is effective opposition existing currently, particularly as political parties become less regionally based and voter support is therefore able to becoem more widespread natioanly based on the party rather than its region of origin (BTI) . Furthermore opposition is also able to play a role in the executive as shown by Joyce Banda's selected cabinate and the high rate of cross-floor support generally (BTI) . However there is also a relativly high level of interfearence in the elctoral commision and pultiple cases of attempted prevention of power exchange, as seen in former vice-president Joyce Banda's rise to power, where the existing cabinate attempted to prevent consitutional process from taking place following the presidents death. Because there is not a significant likelyhood of the oposition gaining power, but it remains more than a little potential it is difficult to select one of the avaliable criterea. Given that it is beter to have a too low rather than too high score, this leave Malawi with a score of 2. Q4: Do all people have full electoral rights and opportunities to participate in the electoral process? (3 possible points) The vast majority of adult citizens are able to participate in the electoral process and have electoral rights, however the quality of participation is extremely limited in rural areas due to extrmemely limited accress to the features of civil society. Also generally low levels of education hinder participation. Furthermore local goveranance is ofter conducted without electons due to limied resource access and sustainable infrustructure. Therefore there are sufficant rights to qualiy Malawi for 2 points. Q5: Is there are free, independent and well-resourced media that is able to act as a check and balance on power? (3 possible points) There are numerous media outlets and although the vast majority are governemnt owned and managed there is also an increasing number of private radio stations with widespread coversage which are well regarded for their unbiased journalism. There are also a number of private newspapaer outlets. However exclusive government and supprotive institution sourced adveritisng is used to put pressure on private outlets through an attempt to reduce funding. Following the death of President M inconstitutional legislation was repealed increasing freedoms of opinion and the press. The increasing freedom of the press goes significanlty towards a score of 2, however it is not sufficant leaving malawi with a score of 1. 10.3/15 possible points for Political Rights Civil Liberties for citizens Q1: Does this regime uphold the rule of law and democratic principles? (3 possible points) There is an excess of power held by the executive. And although the judiciary is essentialy independent it is also often ignored due to a lack of execuive support. Furthermore rapid changes in power mean that more often than not when office holders are investigated for crimes the investigations are not followed through on. Also office holders are usually not investigated until after they are out of office. The anticorruption bureau also has rapid changes in leadership lead by political interfearence. Therefore although rule of law is inherent in the constitution and legislatire and investigations occure fairly regularly they are very rarely actualised. Given the lack of repercussions for political leaders Malawi is only able to score 2 point. Q2: Do all citizens within this regime have access to fundamental human rights, including: Freedom of Assembly and Association; Freedom of Speech and Expression; Freedom of Mobility? Although human rights are affirmed both constitutionally and leiglatively, there is minimal access to restitution and even knowledge of human rights in rural areas, which encompass 80% of the population (BTI) . Furthermore when directed at the government protests are often repressed reducing access to freedom of expression and assembly. Also although citizens have the abilty to appeal to breaches of human rights through the judiciary and decisions are usually in their favour the government tends to ignore these decisions. In terms of suppression I do not feel that a lack of access qualifies as active supression, however there are rights established both in legsislature and practice. Despite this Malawi does not met the criteria for 2 points leaving it with a single point. Q3: Does this country have a free, independent and fair judiciary? There is an majoritivly indenpendant, free & fair judiciary in Malawi, however it has compariatively little power and is therefore unable to enforce constitutional rights. The multii teired system allows for appeals and minimises oportunies for judicial corruption. Because of its limited inluence executive interfearnece in judiciary leadership is also minimised. Although the judiciary lacks power it is generally concidered to be faily independent and therefore qualifies sufficiently for 2 points. Q4: Does this country have effective processes in order to hold the governing regime accountable? These could be measures such as independent Ombudsman, inquiries, parliamentary question time, an upper house of parliament, select committees, etc. Although the legislature and judiciary have some power they are unable to act as a check on the executive. Parliament connot even adssemble without executive permission (BTI) . However there are social and legal constructs capable of reviewing and publicising executive misuse of power which provides valuable information access to the voting public enable minor checks to be created. Also due to a high reliance of external aid there this information when avaliabel internationally creates a pressurised environemtn in which the executive must opperate in order to retain foreign investment. The ineffectual seperation of the powers would reduce Malawi to 1 point without the somewhat effect results of international pressure and increased civil society & judicial influence elevating it to 2 points. Q5: Discrimination? (the right to equal treatment and due process for minority groups) 2.4 There are legally established rights and freedoms regardless of qualitative or quantitative poluation features. Due to a fairly homogenous populaition which feads the accepted perception of a national state there is minismed discrimination (BTI) . However there is extensive rural-urban disparity and lack of resources access. Gender discrimination is minial at a social level but with political represtnation at around 10% (BTI) of elected officials more work needed to reduce glass celling inquality, although the situation is moving in the right direction with the former President being a woman. However there is a heavy empahsis on family and power is often distributed based on nepotism rather than quantifiable merit. Although there is not fair representation for minority groups, there is a distrinct lack of social and procedural discrimination elevating malawi to a 3 point status.

"Croatia",1990,1999,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Croatia - 1993 Q2) I chose 1990 because it was the year Franjo Tudjman gained power. Q3) I chose 1999 because it was the year Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president died. Q4) HDZ won power in a free and fair election in 1990. Subsequent elections were free but not fair until Tudjman's death in 1999 Q5) Every adult over the age of 18 can vote. 16 year olds can vote if they are employed. Q6) There was little potential for the opposition to gain power during Tudjman's time in office because of unfair restrictions of the media and campaigning practices. Q7) All citizens had access to political power, but it was unfair for anyone who opposed Tudjman as there wasn't a level playing field for the opposition Q8) The Croatian media was limited to one station, which restricted the sources of information available to the public. That station was closely controlled by the Tudjman regime to restrict the opposition's campaigning. Q9) I could not find information on the rule of law Q10) Freedom of assembly and speech were limited for Serbian protesters during the war as they presented opposing perspectives. The media faced difficulties with freedom of speech both during and after the war due to heavy control and censorship of the information released. Q11) The judiciary had some issues with operating independently from the government. These issues were rectified in a convention published by the government in 2010. Q12) I could not find a definitive answer about the checks and balances of Croatia's parliament/executive. I can only make an educated guess that the checks and balances employed (if any) were fairly ineffectual due to how much power Tudjman's government had. Q13) Ethnic Serbs were faced with widespread discrimination as a minority due to their opposing political views. They were not protected by the government and encountered brutal violence at the hands of the Croatian public and security forces. Q14) I am fairly confident in my answers, although I have found conflicting sources that reflect opposing attitudes on Tudjman and his positive/negative role in Croatia during the 1990s Q15) Corruption was more common in the top levels of the government during this time rather than in the lower levels of the sector. Q16) Special privileges were given to associates of Tudjman's government due to pervasive cronyism. I considered journal articles, news reports and timelines of the War of Independence in my answers. I had difficulty finding answers for the rule of law and checks and balances. I took educated guesses at those questions. The answers fit well with the questions generally.",2,3,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,1,4,1,12,9,21
"Djibouti",2003,2011,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","Q . 2 & 3: The period of 2003 to 2011 was chosen because of the important political events that took place within this timespan. President Ismail Omar Guelleh was first elected in 1999, taking over from his uncle, dictatorial President Hassan Gouled Aptidon (BBC News, 2015) . However, 2003 held the first multi-party parliamentary elections, where although the opposition coalition, the Union of Democratic Alternative (UAD) won 37% of the votes, the ruling Union of the Presidential Majority ( UMP) received all 65 seats, resulting in unfair representation within parliament (Freedom House, 2006) . Three other significant political events occurred up until 2011 that also contributed to the time range chosen. In 2005, Guelleh won his second six-year term as president as the sole candidate in the election. In 2008, the parliamentary elections were once again won by the UMP, after the three other opposing parties withdrew stating manipulation of the electoral process and abuses from the current government as their reasoning for withdrawing. Finally, marking the end of the time span, in 2010, President Guelleh amended the Djibouti constitution to allow his to run for president for a third time, after previously stating he would retire after two terms. Guelleh was reinstated as president in 2011, after the opposition once again boycotted the election (BBC News, 2015) . These events are the reasons I chose my time span, as the various elections occurring within Djibouti all suggest biased and unjustifiable results, where a manipulation of policies, institutions and rules of procedure has allowed President Guelleh to abuse his position to sustain power. Q. 4: Although there are parliamentary and presidential elections within Djibouti, evidence suggests there is no chance of change. Dominated by the ruling coalition of UMP, lead by President Guelleh, Djibouti is a single party semi-presidential republic, so there is little chance in a democratic change in government. Opposition groups such as the UAD have repeatedly tried to provide challengers but have faced an 'inability to campaign effectively as a result of government control of the media and repression of the opposition's activities' (Freedom House, 2006) . Even when an opposition has participated in the elections, for example in the 2003 legislative elections, results have been debated by the opposition who alleged that the UMP used widespread election fraud such as double voting and the absence of blank ballots of those who did not want to vote for UMP (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . The electoral processes within Djibouti, although give citizens the right to vote, have essentially no effect on the distribution and exercise of power. Q. 5: Suffrage is universal at 18 years of age (Washington: Superintendent of Documents, 2012) . Although the only restriction is the age constraint, the political system within Djibouti is constructed so opposition parties have to register with the government, leading to many boycotting the elections all together. This results in a one-party dominated state, with voters often having only one choice of vote. Voter turn out is often low, only 48% in the 2003 parliamentary elections (Freedom House, 2006) . Because there is often only one party to vote for, citizens are not exercising their right to vote as they realise there is no chance of a change in regime through voting. Q. 6: A multiparty system exists within Djibouti, and as there is universal suffrage, on paper it is possible for anyone to be elected to govern (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . However, the chance of any other party asides UMP receiving representation is low. This is because there is an election law which states 'that the majority victor in each of the country's five electoral constituencies be awarded all seats in that district' so even if a opposition party wins even a minority of the votes, they can receive no representation. (Freedom House, 2006) . The system within Djibouti is constructed as to look democratic, but in actual fact is continually dominated by President Guelleh and the UPM coalition, who consistently ignore demands for electoral reform for opposition parties (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . In 2010, Guelleh amended the constitution, removing the two-term limit for presidents. This allowed him to run for a third term as president, effectively showing how he has used his power and state connections to ensure that there is little possibility for any other party to gain power whilst he is in charge (Freedom House, 2011) . Q. 7: As stated above in question 6, it is possible to try and be elected to govern, but the actual chance of actually getting elected is almost none. Power is concentrated highly amongst Guelleh's own family, with family members holding positions of power in both cabinet and government (Notable Biographies, 2006) . Citizens have the ability to try but the dominance of Guelleh's regime has withstood all opposition parties since he came to power in 1999. Fraudulent elections and strict entry for opposition parties have contributed to the dominance of Guelleh's regime, making access to power for other's extremely difficult (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . Q. 8: Freedom of the media is very restricted, as the Government owns the primary newspapers, radio and television stations such as La Nation (Freedom House, 2011) . This regulates the criticism and backlash that can be published about the Government and although the Djibouti constitution provides freedom of speech and press, the government does obviously not follow these laws (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . 'The Government has used several tactics to intimidate journalists including surveillance and the removal from newsstands of publications that criticized the Government. On February 1 st 2007, police seized printing equipment from the opposition political party Movement for Democratic Revival, publisher of the newsletter Le Renouveau. Houssein Ahmed Farah, the acting director of the newsletter, and three of his editorial staff were arrested and charged with defamation of character for publishing a report of a sex scandal, detained for 2 days, and released. A court ordered Le Renouveau to halt production for 3 months' (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . This shows how an attempt from an independent media source was stopped, showing how difficult it is for internal media outlets to provide checks on power. Q. 9: As the questions progressed I found they were harder to answer/needed more research. The rule of law within Djibouti was reasonably hard to analyse. However, using the World Governance Indicators, regarding the dimension of the rule of law, Djibouti's percentile rank was 22.97 in 2002, 23.92 in 2006 and 24.88 in 2011 (The World Bank, 2014) . This essentially means that the rule of law within Djibouti is weak, and ranks in the bottom 25% on a world scale. However, although this tells me that the rule of law in weak within Djibouti, this answer doesn't really fit any of the option available. So, more research was needed. There are many examples of the rule of law not being upheld by government officials and Guelleh himself. The law itself within Djibouti is everyday law based on the French civil law system, traditional practices and Islamic Law. However, President Guelleh and government officials within this regime do not let the law impede them. F or example, 'security forces often make arrests without the proper decree from the judicial magistrate' (Freedom House, 2012) . Also, 'the law requires arrest warrants and stipulates that the Government may not detain a person beyond 48 hours without an examining magistrate's formal charge' (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . This law is often not enforced, government officials continuously holding prisoners for extended amount of time. Many breaches to constitutional rights also exhibit the rule of law not being followed. The constitution states the right to a fair trial, the prohibition of arbitrary arrest and the protection of human rights just to name a few. However, infibulation (an obvious breach of human rights) consistently occurs in rural areas, yet nobody has ever been convicted of this crime (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . President Guelleh amending the constitution to get rid of the two-term presidential limit is also evidence that he is not subject to the rule of law, as this section of the constitution was aimed to constrain government power. By amending this to continue his authoritarian rule, Guelleh demostrated that there are little checks on his power and the rule of law will do little to impede him. Q. 10: The Djibouti constitution provides freedom of assembly and association, however this is not followed by the government (indicating a breach of the rule of law) (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . The Government only permits peaceful assembly, essentially forcing its citizens to refrain from protests, as they fear the repercussions that will follow. It is a similar circumstance regarding freedom of speech and expression, stated in the constitution but not followed. For example, 'In May 2006 the Government suspended Kaltoum Ali, a journalist for Radio-Television Djibouti and a correspondent of the BBC Somali service, for broadcasting a report that the Ministry of Health falsely claimed a case of avian flu to obtain foreign aid.' (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . The constitution and laws allow for freedom of movement, internally and externally, however once again, the Government sometimes restricts this practice (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . A pattern occurring is that the Government provides all the aspects of democracy in its constitution; yet in practice they are not following these laws. Q. 11: The judiciary is not independent of the executive, supreme courts can overrule lower courts and magistrates are often given life terms. 'Security forces can also arrest Djiboutians without proper authority, despite constitutional requirements that arrests may not occur without a decree presented by a judicial magistrate' (Freedom House, 2006) . This is another instance of the rule of law being breached. For example 'Allegations of politically motivated prosecutions surfaced in 2010 following the conviction of Djibouti's richest businessman, Abdourahman Boreh, on charges of terrorism. A friend-turned-critic of the president, he was accused of directing a grenade attack in Djibouti City. He was not represented by a defence lawyer. Boreh claimed that his 15-year sentence was intended to derail a potential presidential bid in 2011' (Freedom House, 2011) . The judiciary is clearly not independent or free. Q. 12: Regarding effective processes in order to hold the governing regime accountable, this was relatively hard to find information on. I did find this extract from the US Department of State reporting that 'There were no laws to provide public access to government information, and it was unclear whether persons would be granted such access if requested', indicating that there are not any particularly useful checks on power within Djibouti. I therefore made an educated guess that there are likely little to no checks on power, but public dissent would likely cause larger breaches to be investigated if they received international media attention. Q. 13: Djibouti is primarily made up of two ethnic tribal groups, the Issa and the Afari. President Guelleh, who originates from the Issa tribe, rules an Issa dominated government. Members of the Afari tribe do hold majority in the executive, including the Prime Minister and Defence Minister. The Issa's have control the military, civil and security services, and the ruling party. The Afari people, Yemeni Arabs, and non-Issa Somali suffer from social and economic discrimination and marginalisation from many members of the Afari tribe (Freedom House, 2006) . Unofficially, Yemeni Arabs are limited unofficially to one ministerial post each and there are also informal limits on the number of seats in Parliament for each group to preserve balance (U.S. Department of State, 2007) . Although members of the Afari tribe has constitutional rights, the social and economic discrimination they receive signifies that equal treatment is not always used for minority groups such as these. Q. 14: As my timespan is relatively recent, it was reasonably easy to find adequate sources and information on Guelleh's regime. The answers I am not so confident on are those concerning the analysis of the processes that hold Djibouti's regime accountable, as I couldn't find a lot of information on that particular subject. Also, the type of corruption occurring in Djibouti was hard to define, as although there is obvious misuse of public resources occurring, the political corruption occurring within Djibouti more concerns the manipulation of policies to ensure power. Q. 15, 16: There are various methods I used in assessing the level of corruption in Djibouti. The Corruption Perception Index ranks countries on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be, a low score indicating highly corrupt, and a high score indicating very clean. Djibouti had a score of 2.9 in 2007 and 3.0 in 2011 (out of 10) (Find The Data, 2015) . Similarly, there is also the Control of Corruption score, which 'reflects perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain' (Transparancy International, 2015) . Using the range of -2.5 to 2.5, where higher values equal better governance, Djibouti's score in 2011 was -.309. From President Guelleh to government officials, corruption is undeniably present within Djibouti. Concerning corruption from government officials, 'there have been reports in the past of government officials applying pressure on smaller investors to become their 'partners' or to obtain sub-contracts. Despite a substantial improvement in customs transparency under Dubai World's management, there are still reports of business owners attempting to bribe officials to evade import taxes' (Bureau of Economic, Energy and Business Affairs, 2011) .'Corruption as the private misuse of public resources', although a viable definition of corruption, is too narrow to define the corruption within Djibouti. Although the private misuse of public resources does contribute to the level of corruption in Djibouti, there are also a lot of different types of corruption occurring as well. Misuse of public resources, such as President Guelleh consistently issuing large political contracts to his political allies or members of his family shows how corruption is pervasive and entrenched in the Executive (The Economic Intelligence Unit, 2007) . I would use the broader definition of 'Political corruption is a manipulation of policies, institutions and rules of procedure in the allocation of resources and financing by political decision makers, who abuse their position to sustain their power, status and wealth' (Transparancy International, 2015) to defined the type/s of corruption occurring in Djibouti. President Guelleh changing the constitution in 2010 to ensure he could run for an unprecedented third time for President is a primary example of him abusing his position to sustain power (the 'other' category) . Guelleh's entire regime is full of corruption, from almost entirely disregarding the constitution to repress Djibouti citizens the right's of freedom of speech, assembly and expression, to concentrating power within his close circle of friends and family (Special privileges granted to politically-connected people) . Djibouti is very much not free from corruption. Bibliography BBC News. (2015, May 6) . Djibouti profile - Timeline .

"United States",1981,1989,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Peter Lamour argues that the defintion of corruption is subjective and therefore there can be different in different cultures, and also that corruption largely lies within the political system rather than outside of it. The Iran-Contra Affair was one of the main sources of corruption from this era, and it involved the Reagan administration selling arms to Iran, and funnelling profits into undercover operations. Many people have argued that Reagan's administration was the most corrupt of any American president, due to the large amount of scandals that arose during his two terms (Brown University) . As well as the Iran-Contra Affair, there were scandals within the EPA related to perjury. Despite this, the United States is still definitely democratic, and less corrupt than many other states. I found some of the questions quite difficult to answer, due to a lack of accessible information, and that the questions were slightly open to interpretation. For example, I though question six could be either one or two points, depending on whether you would need more than one opposition member that could realistically gain power. The Democrats are the only other party that could take over, as while there are other groups they are far too small to ever come into government. I also struggled to find any information that related directly to the freedom of the press in this era, so I interpreted the mentions that I could find to mean that the press was generally free, although there would be some exceptions that were government influenced (however these would be the outliers) . I also ended up relying a bit on my general knowledge of the States to answer some questions. The United States does not have universal suffrage, as several groups are legally prevented from voting. For example, if you are under 18 were unable to vote. Homeless people also faced issues in being able to register to vote, as they were unable to provide an address to do so. There were varying restrictions across states regarding voting rights of prisoners. Some states prevent anyone who has ever been incarcerated from voting, whereas others allowed those that are on probation to vote. There are also restrictions on the ages of people who are able to run for president, as you must be at least 35 years old to do so. In question 13 I thought it was interesting to note Ronald Reagan's determination to appoint women to the judiciary, however this did not (and still doesn't) equate to equal gender representation at this level. Also, in question 12, the judiciary is appointed by the president, and therefore is susceptible to political influence, reducing its effectiveness as a check and balance on the legislature. Therefore I think this answer is slightly questionable, as it is possible for someone to be appointed by the president and be impartial, but also just as possible and likely for them to be biased and corrupt. The Washington Times argues that Reagan was particularly committed to maintaining an effective judiciary that upheld the rule of law. America also has a continual overrepresentation of people of colour within the justice system, evidence of systematic discrimination based on race and class. While the United States did have checks and balances they clearly were not effective in preventing corruption in the government. Power is restrained because while there were scandal and corruption within Reagan's regime, there were investigations that followed. Works Cited Ceaser, James W. The Enduring Reagan .

"Rwanda",2000,2014,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Not much corruption detected""","In determining these answers I chose a time scale that does not include the transitional 1990s period before, during and immediately after the Rwandan Genocide. This allowed me to consider Rwanda 'afresh'as the country it is today, as opposed to the country it was at the time of those horrific events. Beginning with Paul Kagame's 2000 assumption of the Presidential office, which he still holds, is a good place to begin. Rwanda comes in at 41/150 on the 2014 World Audit Corruption index, which is a fairly middle-of-the-road score -close to states such as the Czech Republic and Namibia, and Saudi Arabia. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index ranks Rwanda ranks similarly, at 55/175. This reflects a general 'somewhere in between'situation across most of the country in regards to corruption -there are some areas where Rwanda can be viewed negatively, but some where Rwanda can be viewed in a positive light. For this reason, I was not entirely satisfied with some of the answers I gave to the questions, as the generalized nature of the test doesn't cater for the nuanced variables of Rwandan politics. Rwanda has universal suffrage -has done, according to womensuffrage.org, since 1961 -and in the last election became the only country in the world where parliament consists of a female majority. Participation through the form of submissions is easily accessible on the Rwandan parliament website. There are Presidential elections every seven years, and parliamentary elections occur (though the President appoints his own cabinet and Prime Minister) . The current President, Paul Kagame, incumbent for 15 years, has however been criticized for allowing himself wide-ranging jurisdiction over governance, and making it difficult for opposition to gain any traction in political campaigns. Human Rights Watch has called into question Kagame's policies of harshly stamping out dissent, often justified as an attempt to avoid another Rwandan genocide -freedom of expression is a concern in Rwanda, and is reflected through a low rank on the World Press Freedom index (162 nd out of 180 countries ranked) . Rwanda cannot be said to have a media that satisfactorily acts as a check and balance on power. Rwanda had a score of -0.3 in the 2010 Transparency International corruption index 'Rule of Law'section, meaning Rwanda is again placed in the 'middle-of-the-road'grey area: the score hints at probable minor breaches of legal integrity, but shies away from claiming any major incidences. Certainly a brief online search did not uncover any major Rwandan political scandals or controversies in recent history. The score is likely more reflective of the iron grip with which Kagame holds most of the power in Rwanda -the legality of this grip can be called into question.

"Portugal",1995,2002,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","My first country of research is Portugal in the time period of 1995 to 2002. The Portugese governmental system is said to be Parliamentary Partidocracia, which is said to be a pseudo democracy where the citizens only vote for the party and not for the individual person. The parties put forward their representative from a pre-formed list. In 1974 there was a bloodless military coup and broad democratic reforms were implemented. The current constitution was adopted in 1976 and since 1974 to 2014 Portugal has had 25 different governments. Question 4 discusses whether Portugal has free and fair elections. According to my research as to whether this is the case, I came across many articles which described elections in Portugal coupled with the words 'free' and 'fair'. One such article is a case study by Marina Costa Lobo called 'Portugal: extended voting rights and decreasing participation,' this stated that since the fall of dictatorship there has been free elections. Question 5 is about the country's level of universal suffrage and according to the Governo de Portugal website, states that everyone over the age of 18 has to vote and that all people can vote. There is universal suffrage for all. Question 6 is asking whether there is effective opposition and possibility for them to be elected. Upon researching it is clear to see that there is in fact very clear opposition as there have been many different parties in power. As previously stated there have been 25 different governments. Question 7 is about the access to political power and who is able to run for government. There seem to be some restrictions based on the fact that the citizens aren't elected to From my research into the idea of a free and independent media in relation to question 8 it was discovered that there seems to be a degree of self censorship and government control. Upon reading an article from Press Reference about the Portuguese media, they state that all of the media used to be controlled by the government and heavily censored until the coup in 1974. The new incoming government abolished censorship and implemented a free and fair media. The state however did continue to own media companies but they were to elect a board to run the company on their behalf. In 1999 there was only one newspaper O Correrio da Manha that was exclusively owned by journalists. During this time period there were a few censorship scandals including one in 1995 when a reporter published some scandolous articles about society's rich and famous which resulted in bomb threats and the like. However the author was writing under a pseudonym and was subsequently suspended by the company and this led to claims of self censorship. Questions 9-13 bring us to the civil liberties available to citizens in Portugal between 1995-2002. This part was slightly more difficult to research as it requires a lot more a judgement call based on evidence. There are ways to measure some forms of civil liberties but they might not always be the most accurate ways of measuring. I chose to use Freedom House to provide answers to most of these questions as they provide a good comprehensive idea of these concepts based on extensive research. The Freedom House measurements are only taken back to 1999 but it would be reasonably safe to assume that based on the steady position of Portugal from there until 2002 that the previous 4 years would have been much the same. Portugal's rankings by Freedom House classify it as a Free nation with scores of 1 which is the best possible to be achieved. Therefore based on this evidence it would be safe to assume that civil liberties were well protected during this time period. It also notes explicitly that the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of speech are well protected. Question 12 referencing whether there are processes to hold the government and regime accounted for I found exceptionally hard to research. In this case I have decided based on what I already know about the political situation in Portugal to take an educated guess and state that there are in fact effective processes for checks on power. I have made this decision based on the fact that the constitution was enforced in 1974 a good 20 years before my time period of study and therefore it would be reasonable to assume that it would be well enough established that the government could be held accountable. This coupled with the excellent freedom house ratings at the time provide the basis for this decision. Question 13 asks whether there is equal treatment of minority groups. This was also hard to find accurate information about relating to the time period so I was therefore forced to deduce a decision based on some articles which discuss the problem but not in specific reference to this time. The source I based this on was by World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous People. This provides a historical analysis of the lives of indigenous people in Portugal and their treatment in history. It states that in the 1990's there was a tightening of immigration laws but this failed to check the new wave of immigrants. Therefore skipping to the analysis of the present day it is stated that there is an exceptionally diverse culture and a high number of immigrants. There are significant issues with discrimination which is despite anti-discrimination laws and that this discrimination has been underpinned for decades. This therefore provides a basis to make a judgement that at the time of study that there would have also been issues of discrimination of such minority groups. The final two questions are a discussion of the levels of political corruption seen in Portugal. Upon assessing the Corruption Perceptions Index which is available from it's inception in 1995 we can see that Portugal seems to maintain a fairly standard world ranking in the range of 20-30 over this time period and an average score of about 6.5/10. From these results it seems safe to draw the conclusion that corruption does exist in some forms in Portugal over this time but it was ultimately not exceptionally prominent. For the final question I relied on some research from Global Secruity.org which states in the past there have been scandals involving bribery of officials. Prime Minister Jose Socrates who was the Environment Minister from 1995-2002 it is speculated that he took bribes to waive environmental regulations to build a shopping mall in Lisbon and the payouts were given to his family. There was also a letter sent to the Portuguese government that the UK Serious Fraud Office was investigating 6 individuals for suspected bribery and fraud. This alongside with other examples in the article provides evidence of the types of corruption seen in Portugal.

"Sri Lanka",2005,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Justification for Ratings I selected 2005-2015 as the period of time around my reference year because it represents the entirety of Mahinda Rajapaksa's presidency (Sinhala), the regime that both defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009, thus ending the 26 year civil war, and was also accused of war crimes, corruption, and increased repression of rights (Freedom House, 2008) . Political Rights Q1: Judging the freeness and fairness of Sri Lanka's elections during this regime was a difficult task. Whilst the country has a post-independence history of genuinely competitive elections with a frequent change of government (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2015), there were, as Freedom House pointed out in 2008, a few 'irregularities'which compromised its status as fully free and fair. One thing in particular led me to allocate 2 rather than 3 points here. The LTTE, who controlled certain parts of the North and East of Sri Lanka (before their defeat in 2009), actively prevented citizens in those areas from voting in the executive elections. Many of the citizens in those areas were and are Tamils, and would likely have voted for the opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe of the United National Party in the 2005 elections, rather than Rajapaksa. Since the race was tight, with Rajapaksa winning by less than a two per cent margin, it is quite possible that the LTTE's actions changed the outcome of the elections. There were also accusations that Rajapaksa himself conspired with the LTTE, paying them to suppress the Tamil vote (Freedom House, 2008) . If found to be true, serious doubt would be cast on the proposition that Sri Lankan elections were wholly free and fair. In the 2010 election, Rajapaksa won by a landslide, however the opposition seemed to have been disadvantaged in that the state shut down all independent Sri Lankan news websites including Tamil language sites in the days leading up to the elections (Sify News, 2010), thus limiting access to opposition material. This kind of manipulation further compromised the status of Sri Lankan elections as free and fair. In the 2015 election, Rajapaksa was defeated by opposition leader Maithripala Sirisena, by nearly a four per cent margin (The Guardian, 2015) . Rajapaksa reportedly attempted a coup d'etat, however the military refused and the new government took over. In sum, I judged elections between 2005 and 2015 to be largely free, but with the opposition facing some obstacles to election. This situation warranted an allocation of 2 points, rather than 3. Q2: Sri Lanka has universal suffrage (CIA World Factbook) . All adults aged 18 or over are allowed to vote in elections. Therefore, 3 points are awarded. Q3: It is safe to say that Sri Lanka has always had an effective opposition, post-independence. There have been regular changes of government since 1948 (WWW Virtual Library -Sri Lanka), and although matters for the opposition were complicated during Rajapaksa's regime, as articulated in Q1, the 2015 elections demonstrate that the United National Party never lost its ability to win. The effectiveness of the opposition may have been a little lower between 2005 and 2015, but on a three point scale using integers only, I find it acceptable to award 3 points. Q4: Many people had theoretical access to political power in Sri Lanka from 2005-2010 -in 2013 for example, the Tamil National Alliance won Sri Lanka's Northern Provincial Council elections (The Diplomat, 2013), despite the Sinhala hegemony of Rajapaksa's regime - however Freedom House (2008) documented complaints from Tamils about discrimination against them in hiring for government jobs, and indeed the aggressive campaigns of Rajapaksa's Sinhala government against the Tamil LTTE and thousands of innocent Tamils alike likely reduced the political potency of that major minority group overall. I cautiously award 2 points here. Q5: Sri Lanka, particularly under Rajapaksa, was notorious for having a heavily censored, non-free media environment (Freedom House, 2008), and Reporters Without Borders has described the press situation in Sri Lanka as 'difficult', ranking the country 165 out of 173 in 2008. Various surreptitious mechanisms such as the Official Secrets Act, anti-terrorism regulations and defamation laws made systematic repression of independent media possible, with numerous journalists being threatened or even jailed (Freedom House, 2008) . I award 1 point. Civil Liberties Q6: On the question of the rule of law, I found Sri Lanka's standards to have degraded significantly during Rajapaksa's tenure. Many abuses of human rights were associated with the civil war, many against Tamil citizens suspected of being involved with or supporters of the LTTE (Freedom House, 2008) (Human Rights Watch, 2015) . Both Rajapaksa's regime and the LTTE were responsible for numerous arbitrary detentions, abductions and killings. Whilst not totally arbitrary and rogue, Sri Lanka's rule of law became very shaky under the guise of anti-terrorism. Only 1 point is merited. Q7: Many human rights were abused under Rajapaksa's government, especially before the end of the civil war (Amnesty International, 2015) (Freedom House, 2008) . As articulated in the above, freedom of speech and expression, right to due process, freedom of association and other rights were abused. Loss of rights was not total, but certainly considerable, so I allocate 1 point. Q8: In pages 275-278 of the Global Corruption Report 2007 by Transparency International, the Sri Lankan judiciary is evaluated, and corruption is well documented. Judges were expected to toe the political line or risk being dismissed, and corruption in the form of bribes or even sexual favours has always been common in the lower court. These factors compromise the independence and fairness of the judicial system, so I am inclined to award only 1 point. Q9: Any measures that were in order to hold the regime accountable, such as the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), became increasingly compromised during Rajapaksa's tenure. One obvious manifestation of this was that investigators at the NHRC and the National Police Commission were appointed by the executive (Freedom House, 2008) ! Investigations were still conducted, however the questionability of independence coupled with a lack of resources (Freedom House, 2008) severely compromised the ability of these organisations to do their jobs well. 1 point is awarded. Q10: There was discrimination against minority groups such as Tamils, particularly during the civil war, as discussed above. Because of the LTTE, many innocent Tamils were regarded with suspicion and in many instances detained and maltreated without due process. (Freedom House, 2008) . Also, Sinhala only legislation introduced in 1956, which made Sinhala the only official language of Sri Lanka, continued to be an area of concern for Tamils. Access to university education, the justice system and government employment favoured Sinhalese Sri Lankans (Freedom House, 2008) . I find 2 points to be a reasonable score here. Corruption Q11: Corruption is quite common in Sri Lanka, especially at lower levels. According to Business Anti-Corruption Portal (2015), almost one fifth of companies in Sri Lanka expect to pay some kind of bribe in order to secure government contracts. And as discussed previously, the justice system is known to be rife with bribery, with citizens paying officials to investigate claims. Transparency International ranks Sri Lanka 38/100 on corruption, which is certainly a poor score. I award 1 point. Q12: Corruption under Rajapaksa was evident in several forms. Firstly, the government not only condoned but was involved in illegal business dealings. One example of this was the illegal privatisation of public enterprises (Whistleblower.org) . Secondly, as just mentioned, officials were known to take bribes (Business Anti-Corruption Portal) . And thirdly in the 2010 elections, Rajapaksa's government was accused of misusing public funds to boost campaign advertising and gain an unfair advantage in the polls (The Guardian, 2010) . This was almost certainly not the only instance of misappropriation of public resources.

"Morocco",2003,2006,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Other""","I chose this time period using the scales on freedom house to determine the period of time including the reference date of 2006, that elements of democracy were similar. Here is my justification of my answers - I tried to choose the most accurate out of the choices available. Question 4 - The elections for places of government have sometimes been recognised on an international stage as free and fair. In 2003, they were regarded as the most represented in the country's history. However it is a monarchy based on the foundation of Islamic religion. The king is recognised as the highest power and therefore has the power to corrupt the elections - this place of power does not work through democracy but is hereditary and therefore no 'free and fair' elections exist for head of state. As well as this, he has the power to appoint PM and other political positions. Hence the elections have corruption from the government in power - see explanation for Q6. Question 5 - It does recognise universal suffrage - however it is questionable as of the effectiveness of their votes. Question 6 - In 2003, the Islamist Justice and Development Party was forced by the government into entering less candidates into the elections - however they do create competition in the elections. Question 7 - It is a monarchy - so the head of state power is only available to one particular line. Many significant positions of power are either directly appointed by the king or heavily under the influence of the king. MORE Question 8 - more like 1.5 - There is lively independent media but a lot of it is still state controlled. The only media with nationwide coverage is heavily kept a close eye on. Moroccans have access to about 2000 media outlets. Laws that can hold journalist liable are in place with few exceptions - In 2004, king pardoned 6 journalists who were convicted of treason (insulting the king in the media) . Some media does show opposition to the king but this is exercised with extreme caution and only to a minimal extent. Question 9 - In 2004 the law reform meant that the rule of law was enforced more greatly. However issues with enforcing rule of law stem from the king having power of the judiciary and a lack of adequate policies for procedural standards. Since the king is seen as the 'Commander of the Faithful' - tasked with protecting the liberties of his people, he can be exempt from the law because he has the power to reform the law. This lack of accountability, and centralisation of power goes against the promotion of the rule of law. Question 10 - basic human rights are upheld however there are significant restrictions to activities that represent government opposition. For example trade unions are active but only because they are consented to be from the king - the right to assembly is on the strict basis that the assembly is approved by the king. Question 11 - Although it has an active judiciary, the king is head of the supreme council. Therefore there is a lack of checks and balances from the executive and legislator towards the judiciary. Question 12 - No effective checks and balances exist because no-one can question the kings reign - he holds an extreme concentration of power. The king appoints the ministers and can dismiss them. As well as this, he also has the power to dissolve parliament, call for elections, issue decrees, control the armed forces, be the chief religious leader, and appoint the Supreme Court judges. Question 13 - The king is wary of minority groups such as extremist islamics. Post 2003, Casablanca bombings - their behaviour has been closely monitored and restrictions have been put into place - especially since Morocco's foreign relations with the War on Terror's frontmen: the USA, have grown. However there are freedoms for minorities - e.g. the very small minority of Jews amongst a heavily Islamic population (and Islamic head of state) have freedom to worship.",1,3,2,1,1,2,2,1,0,1,4,0,8,6,14
"Burundi",1993,2003,"""Other""","Between 1993 and 2003 Burundi was wrapped up in an incredibly violent civil war. Because of this, the political situation is incredibly difficult to analyse. There is also the strong political divide in Burundi that must be taken into consideration. Two main ethnic groups make up Burundi's population. There are the Hutu who make up over 80% of Burundi's population, and the more politically dominant Tutsi. In 1993, the Hutu president Melchior Ndadye was assisnated during a military coup undertaken by the heavily tutsi-dominated Burundian army. It was Ndadye's assisination that sparked an array of conflicts between the Tutsi and Hutu, ultimately leading to a civil war that lasted over a decade. It was due to the widespread conflict across Burundi, as well as neighbouring Rawanda, that information on the political environment between 1993 and 2003 was difficult to evaluate. In 1999, Burundi was struggling to establish a stable political system. The civil war was making it incredibly difficult for Burundi to hold elections as many citizens were caught in the violence between the Hutu and Tutsi. The options that we were given in this regime classification system really relied on some form of stability within the country. The issues that arise with Burundi is that even though there were levels of political and civil freedoms, the civil war made it hard for people to express these freedoms. My issue with the questions is that they are looking to evaluate the GOVERNMENTS involvement in rgiths restrictions while a large proportion of this restriction in Burundi was caused by guerilla groups. With 2 presidents assisnated and one overthrown in a period of 3 years, Tutsi president Pierre Buyoya took control of the country forhis second term. Although he was not elected to his position, and he saw the suspension of the countries existing constitution, Buyoya did begin to draft new political moves that saw Burundi taking steps towards democratic rule. Government was expanded and two vice presidential positions were created (with the idea to bring on one representative from the Hutu group and another from the Tutsi) . Even without democratic eleciton Buyoya was undertaking policies to help support Burundi during it's transitional period. 1993 - 1999 saw Burundi's civil rights slowly and steadily cut down. This began to change as the civil war started wrapping up. 2000 - 2003 saw a reintroduction of many civil rights from the media coveying a more balanced viewpoint, to the countries labour code continuing to protect workers union membership and even union strikes. Other freedoms, such as religion, are also observed. Negotiations to end the civil war were being undertaken between 1998 and 2002 before some resolution was finally reached. These negotiations kept being placed on hold due to continuous bursts of violence from both Tutsi and Hutu militant groups. After negotiations finally begin to wrap up in 2002, Burundi is well and truely transitioning towards a omre demorcracy focussed political system. With a new constitution and new voting system in place, Buyoya stood down as president in April 2003. Buyoya's Hutu vice president was elected and focussed his government on closing the gap between the two warring factions within Burundi.",2,3,2,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,10,8,18
"Algeria",1991,2012,"""Condoning illegal business dealings""","It is important to note that roughly the first half of the time frame I have studied was a time of civil war. This means that some data was hard to come by, and many institutions such as elections were non-existent. I chose the timeframe of 1991 -2012 to take into account the effects of the civil war upon Nigeria, as well as the recent civil unrest occurring around the same time as the Arab Spring in 2011/2012. In regard to whether Nigeria has free and fair elections, whether effective opposition is able to be elected, and whether all citizens have access to power, the following information is relevant. From the period of 1991 -1999 no elections occurred at all because Nigeria was in a period of civil war. The first election occurred in 1999 (which is actually regarded as being before the end of the civil war) . The election was regarded as so fraudulent by society and the other candidates that most withdrew from the election in protest, meaning an easy rise to victory for the military-backed Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Frequent elections began to be held in post-civil war Nigeria. However, there are ulterior powers who control the composition of government much more than actual votes. These are mainly powerful political actors in the military or intelligence services. This means that not al citixens have equal access or meaningful access to political power. Moreover, in 2008 the Constitution was amended to give the president greater powers, and to repeal the two-term limit on presidential incumbents. This led to Bouteflika being re-elected for his third term in 2009. Candidates also withdrew from the 2009 presidential election following this amendment to the constitution because they believed it was clear that Bouteflika's re-election was a done deal. Despite there being universal suffrage for Algerians over 18, there is low public faith in the power of voting to change things and this is reflected by dismally low voter turnout statistics (below 50% of eligible population) . The media is not entirely free. While independent forms of media do exist (mainly newspapers) they are reliant upon the state to be published and printed, which leads to self-censorship to ensure they are published. Also, state sponsorship favours forms of media which are pro-government further encouraging self-censorship. The Government in 2009 passed legislation allowing the state to block websites which were seen as antagonistic towards public order, meaning the internet is monitored by the State. Access to fundamental rights is inhibited by the State. Many organisations such as trade unions, are aligned with the State meaning they are not truly independent and do not necessarily carry out their intended function, particularly if that function is contrary to the State's objectives. Any non-government organisations require state approval and many Islamic-focused organisations are treated as highly suspicious, probably a deeply held prejudice resulting from the civil war. As noted earlier, freedom of expression is inhibited by the lack of freedom of the press, but also by the need for citizens to self-censor in order to avoid defamation charges or other consequences. In 2011/2012 when protests became more widespread and frequent it also became clear that the Government had little regard for the rights to protest and to freedom of assembly, when many protests turned violent and many protesters were imprisoned. The judiciary is heavily influenced by the government, meaning the judiciary is not independent. There are few checks and balances on those in power in Nigeria. Despite having a bicameral parliament, the President appoints roughly a third of the members of the upper house. Whilst the lower house is elected, elections are questionable and it is likely electoral fraud is rampant as outlined earlier. Minorities do not seem to face systematic discrimination. However, being a predominantly Muslim nation, non-Muslims can only gather at state-approved locations. It may seem strange, but the State is more concerned about monitoring the Islamic communities for radical activities again most likely as a result of the civil war and seeking to prevent anything similar. Corruption most commonly occurs as a part of private business. It is quite difficult to gauge the severity of the issue of corruption in regard to State dealings. I primarily used data from Freedom House in order to answer these questions.",1,2,2,0,1,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,6,5,11

I understood question six to be reffering to political parties in democratic elections rather than opposition forces engaged in rebellion, because Congo (Brazzaville) did have an active opposition at the time, just not in a form that fits in the democratic system. Similarly I have rated sufferage as the lowest because of the irrevelance of the democratic process, taking into account the actual impact of a vote as opposed to the legal definition which was not practised. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/1998/congo-republic-brazzaville#.VWGthfmqqko http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/Congo2010.pdf",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,2

Charles Taylor's electoral slogan in 1997 more or less summed up the form his rule would take. After 20 years of chaos in Liberia, of which Taylor played a prominent part, he was elected president by a landslide in 1997 on a promise of resuming the civil war should he lose. Whilst the voting itself was judged free and fair by international observers, its pretty damn obvious that theres a problem here. Enlisting former Paramilitaries from the former Yugoslavia, General Butt Naked and Children from the age of four (who have been filmed canibalising enemies and charging into battle armed only with pool noodles) into his armies, Taylor's rule was characterised by him launching proxy wars against his neighbours, and raising revenue almost exclusively from illegal means (the one exception being in the Liberian ship registry) . The legacy of Charles Taylor's rule has left Liberia described by Vice news as quite possibly 'The Most F***ed up place on earth'. According to the Guardian, Legal Judgements were sold to the highest bidder and Police and Judges had their salaries withheld if they refused to execute Taylor's will. With the country operating a common law system based upon that of the United States, this has left Liberia's system of precedent in shambles. Despite strong constitution and a history of democracy, it was reguarly violated. When Sanctions were imposed by the UN, Taylor turned to blood diamonds to fund his rule. Whilst some media outlets, did exist, Liberia's low literacy rates and low television/radio ownership meant that no fourth estate as we know within the first world, had not developed substantially by the time of his rule. Nonetheless, he had taken over the main radio station in the run up to his election. In a country wrecked by ethnic conflict (Liberia was established as a colony for Freed African American Slaves, who found themselves at odds with the population already living there), Taylor exploited it further, relying upon such divisions to maintain his power. Peoples of certain tribes were purged from positions of power. After losing control of the Capital Monrovia after a four year long civil war in 2003, Taylor fled to Nigeria. He was later extradicted to the hague after trying to slip accross the border to Cameroon in 2006 carrying large amounts of Heroin and Cash. In 2013 he was found guilty on all 11 counts by which he was charged with crimes against humanity. Interestingly, it is worth noting that he was at one point a CIA asset. Note: Perhaps in a reflection of how chaotic and corrupt Taylor's rule was, Transparency international were not able to conduct their surveys in the country under Taylor.",2,3,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,3,0,9,3,12
"Russian Federation",1999,2012,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Other""","I choose the time period of 1999-2012 because this is when Putin first came into power and started to consolidate his power and move Russia into a more authoritarian, corrupt system. Russia has processes to hold the government accountable such as the legislature that consists of the Duma or lower chamber and the Federation Council or the upper chamber and the courts but these are not effective in practice. Russia's problem is superexecutivism, a bloated, muscle bound executive that is neither balanced nor monitored by the legislature or the courts. The Russian constitution means the President has the power to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister which Putin has used to consolidate his power. Also half the members of the upper chamber are appointed by governors who are appointed themselves by the President. Therefore, Putin can use this to his advantage. The 1993 Consitution provides the citizens for freedom of speech and expression, freedom of mobility and freedom of assembly and association but there is heavy suppression and monitoring. In 1999 the government exerted pressure on the media and Russia's powerful financial groups acquired control of most major media outlets which has connections to the government or other political figures. Therefore, there was no editorial indpendence. In 2003, the government had controlled all of the national television networks and at least 19 journalists have been killed since Putin came to power. Freedom of expression has been limited further with laws passed on extremism making it possible to crack down on any speech, organisation, or activity that lacks offical support. In 2011 as Duma elections approached businessmen close to Putin purchased additonal television, radio and newspaper assests. Therefore, the media is subjected to heavy censorship, government intervention and self-censorship with the threat of being murderd so can no act as a check or balance on power. Freedom of mobility is restricted because adults must carry internal passports while traveling and to obtain many government services. In regards, to freedom of assembly in 1999 the government largely respected this with numerous political rallies and other demonstrations which occurred throughout the year. However, the governmnet has consistently reduced this with overwhelming police repsonses, the use of force, and routine arrests have discouraged unsanctioned protests. A 2006 law imposed new reporting requirements on NGOs, giving bureuacrats exensive discretion in deciding which groups could register and it also placed tight controls on the use of foreign funds. Russia does not uphold the rule of law with arbitrary power wielded by the state with the use of the judiciary to prosecute any threat to state power. The judiciary is clearly not independent and is subject to political interference, corruption and chronic under-funding. Police routinely use torture against detainees to force confessions but are rarely prosecuted for committing these abuses. The circumstances surrounding the 2009 death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in pre-trial detention, after he accused government employees of embezzling millions of dollars, suggested that the authorities had deliberately denied him medical treatment. Also, judges will accept as evidence confessions made during torture. Career advancements within the criminal justice system are tied to compliance with Kremlin preferences and the justice system is effectively a tool of the executive branch. The case of Mikhail Khordokovsky is an example of this; he was jailed on dubious charges and his prison sentence extended apparently on the instructions of superiors at the Moscow City Court. Since 2003, jury trials have been allowed for serious cases and are more likely to acquit defendants. However, these can be overturned by higher courts which can order retrials until the desired outcome is achieved. Russian citizens often feel that domestic courts do not provide a fair hearing and have increasingly turned to the European Court of Human Rights. Minority groups have minimal rights and the government often violates these. The violation is mostly through residence permits which severely hinders the ability of outsiders to register to live or work in certain regions. These limit the right of citizens to choose their place of residence which targets mainly the ethnic minorities and migrants from Caucasus or Central Asia. Immigrants and ethnic minorities particularly those who appear from the Caucasus or Central Asia face governmental and societal discrimination and harassment. Sexual minorities also encounter discrimination and abuse, and gay rights demonstrations are often attacked by counterdemonstrators or suppressed by the authorities. Elections in Russia are not free and fair although everyone in the country can vote that is over 18. Therefore, Russia is not an electoral democracy. In the 2008 presidential election, state dominance of the media was on full display, debate was absent and Putin was able to pass the office to his handpicked succesor, Dmitry Medvedev. In 2011 the Duma elections were deeply flawed with limited political competition, a lack of fairness and convergence of the state and overning party according to the OSCE. There is an opposition but there is little chance it will ever gain power. The tightly controlled media, misuse of adminstrative resources including the courts make it extremely diffcult for genuine opposition parties to win representation. Also, beginning with the 2007 elections parties must gain at least 7 percent of the vote to enter the Duma, parties cannot form electoral coalitions and would-be parties must have at least 40,000 members. This makes it extremely diffcult for any oppositon party. People do not have equal access to political power with women in particular who have particular difficulty in achieving this. They hold 13 percent of the Duma's seats and less than 5 percent of the Federation Council's. Only three of 26 cabinet members are women. Corruption is defined as the private misuse of public resources this is common but only at some levels of the state which tends to be the elite where the power is concentrated. However, this question suggests an answer that does not fit well with Russia as corruption in Russia is pervasive throughout the government and business world but it takes other forms. For example, Russian authorities are rarely able to obtain successful prosecutions of influential businessmen and politicians. Also, members of the old Soviet Communist elite use underhand tactics to obtain control of key industrial and business sectors, therefore there is no equality of opportunity in Russian government. This lack of accountability enables bureaucrats to act with impunity. However, the other common forms of corruption that occurred were bribe taking by public officials and special privileges granted to politically connected people which is common in Russia. In April 2011, Medvedev ordered all government officials to leave any positions they held on the boards of state-owned companies but despite these formal changes the state still has extensive control over important firms. Also, large tax penalties imposed on select companies have illustrated the corruption involved. References: Bonnell, Victoria E., & Breslauer, George W.

"Myanmar",1990,1997,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","It was difficult to decide whether to give Myanmar 0 points or 1 point for the first classification question of whether or not there were free and fair elections for the state. In the end I decided to go with 0 points as the only election that was held during this time was right at the beginning of the time period chosen in 1990. The State Law and Restoration Council (SLORC) held Multi-party elections in May 1990, the outcome being that the Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party won 392 of 485 seats. (Author Unknown, 'Burma: a brief political history ', ABC News, 2010, www.abc.net.au ) . However, although The National League for Democracy Party took out the majority of vote the SLORC refused to acknowledge the result and retained its repressive grip of power ever since. (Author Unknown, 'History of Burma ', CFOB, 2004, www.cfob.org ) Therefore I chose to give Myanmar during this time 0 points because only one election was held, however it had no influence on the composition of the government at time. My answer to question 5 sort of contradicted my answer to question 4, however I gave Myanmar 3 points for universal suffrage because when elections have been held within Myanmar, every adult over the age of 18 has been eligible to vote, with the voting day for the election of 1990 being relatively free and fair. (' Q&A on Elections in Burma', Human rights watch, 2010, www.hrw.org ) . Question 6 was an easy 2 points. Within Myanmar, there is an opposition called The National League for Democracy, leg by Aung San Suu Kyi. However, with the extent of repression within the country there is little potential for this party to gain power. This was specifically seen in 1988 when a multi-party election was being held and it was observed that the National League for Democracy were gaining too may supporter, a group of the army sparked a military coup which created SLORC, which remained in control of Myanmar through the 1990s. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest by the SLORC and was cut off from any communication from the outside world, remaining this way until she was released in 1995. ('Profile: Aung San Suu Kyi', BBC News, 2014, www.bbc.com ) In 1995 when she was released, she endured continual harassment from the military and her political activity was restrited, showing the extent to which the SLORC within Myanmar had constructed a system where there was little potential for opposition to gain power. ('Aung San Suu Kyi Return to Burma', Bio, www.biography.com ) . In terms of access to political power, I gave Myanmar 0 points because the military in charge of the country at the time had massive restrictions on opposition parties. Aung San Suu Kyi was put under house arrest as she posed too much of a threat to the SLORC and this is a prime example of how the majority of people do not have any access to political power; because the SLORC represses it. It was difficult tossing up between whether to give Myanmar O points or 1 point because through doing research on this topic, it was obvious that Ann San Suu Kyi gained a lot of support through her leadership of The National League for Democracy, however in my opinion the reason her voice was heard in the first place, was because she was the daughter of Bogyoke Aung San, who was a Burmese revolutionary and lead Myanmar to independence in 1948. Although she was promoting beliefs in support of societies interests, the fat that she was daughter of a Burmese hero, would have definitely made an impact. However, I went with 0 points because although she won the election she had been put under house arrest and the votes were not acknowledged, meaning that the military remained in power. In 1990 after the election was held, the SLORC formed a National Constitution Convention rather than a parliament. This constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press, however the government prohibited the exercise of these rights in practice, hence why I gave Myanmar 0 points for free, independent and well-resourced media. Going into the 90's, the number of news papers had decreased from 30 to 8 and as well as this, journalists are often tormented and threatened out of posting unfavourable news for the country and regime. As well as newspapers, all other forms of communication, including domestic and foreign books and periodicals, stage plays, movies and musical recordings, were subject to government control and censorship. This just shows the extent to which media was in no way free and unrestricted. ( (' Q&A on Elections in Burma', Human rights watch, 2010, www.hrw.org ) . ('Media -Control of Media in Burma', Online Burma/Myanmar Library, 2012, www.burmalibrary.org ) . In a report done by Freedom House, it is said that during this time Myanmar had severe restrictions on freedom of speech, press, association and other fundamental rights. ('Burma -Freedom in the World', Freedom House, https://freedomhouse.org ) . In doing research it became obvious that this was accurate information as the human rights violations during this time were immense. The army was responsible for the beatings and killings of civilians and the miss-treatment of people within society in general. The SLORC also arrested people who advocated democracy and human rights. ('Myanmar Profile -Timeline ' BBC News, 2015, www.bbc.com ) . I gave Myanmar 0 points, as the citizens unfortunately did not have access to any of the fundamental human rights mentioned. As well as this, during this time the rule of law was non-existent and the Junta controlled the judiciary. ('Burma -Freedom in the World', Freedom House, https://freedomhouse.org ) . Question 12, which was on whether the country has effective processes in order to hold the governing regime accountable, was a question I struggled with, however, I made an educated guess giving Myanmar 0 points. This was because I know there was no upper house of parliament, no ombudsman and no select committees, therefore I can happily assume there were no checks and balances on power and certainly no independent bodies establish to investigate misuse of power. Therefore, there were no checks and balances on power occurring at the time. For minority groups, there was no representation within the regime and this continued throughout the whole time period. The constitution that was active from 1990 through till 1997 did not acknowledge different ethnic minorities within Myanmar, therefore I gave Myanmar 0 points as there were no effective rights or measures put in place to empower and protect these minority groups. ('The will of the people; Human Rights and Constution making in Burma', Janelle M. Diller, 1991 Oxford, England, www.ibiblio.org ) . In terms of question 15, from 1990 to 1997, corruption was present within Myanmar. Geographically Myanmar has a lot of natural resources including minerals and oil and despite this mineral wealth, Myanmar was (and remains) one of the least developed countries, mainly due to the corruption within the country. ('Myanmar ', Natural Resource Governance Institute, www.resourcegovernance.org ) . I struggled in which category to put Myanmar's corruption into, however in the end I went with 'misuse of public resources by top officials' because the country made billions of dollars yearly from its natural resources, however society was never able to enjoy these benefits as profits went directly to the military.",0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0,5
"Kazakhstan",1999,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Justification- Kazakhstan regime from 1999-2015 Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan has been under the same authoritarian style regime until today. President Nursultan Nazarbayev has been in power since 1989, today he remains the last president of the Soviet Era; however, my research focuses on his regime from the 1999. I have conducted my research across this long period of time mainly because his regime has not undergone any substantial change. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union the Nazarbayev regime has not been challenged. This is evident through his election triumphs over the years. In 1999 election he won with a majority of 80%, furthermore, in 2005, he won 90% of the vote and more recently in 2011 he was re-elected with 97.7% of the nationâ<U+0080><U+0099>s vote. Although evidence suggests that Nazarbayev has received popularity in Kazakhstan through his economic success in foreign trade deals and through â<U+0080><U+0098>stabilisingâ<U+0080><U+0099> ethnic relations. However, the government has attracted much criticism due to accusations of corruption in all aspects of society, which further restricts civil liberties. The authoritarian regime in Kazakhstan is a complex one. Elections are held to make the government seem legitimate; however, overwhelming evidence suggests that these are corrupt. Nazarbayev claims that Kazakhstan will eventually become democratic, however, if this occurs to quickly Kazakhstan runs the risk of instability. As a result civil rights abuses continue, and media and religious groups continue to be suppressed, and this will be discussed in more detail below. Kazakhstan does hold elections; however, it is evidently not an electoral democracy. Furthermore, the constitution allows for Nazarbayev to monopolise control over all branches of government, thus he is not subject to the rule of law and there are no checks and balances on the executive branch. Furthermore, evidence from various sources suggests that the elections held are illegitimate due to a combination of reasons. This is largely evident in the 2005 election. BBC reported that the OSCE (Europeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s main poll monitor) observed ballot box stuffing, intimidation of the opposition, and media bias during the election period. Furthermore, during this term in 2007, he amended the constitution to allow a president to be elected for an unlimited amount of terms. Nazarbayev not only wields power through his unlimited controls over the state that is enshrined in the constitution, but a corrupt electoral system allows him to retain his presidency. Civil liberties are increasingly suppressed in Kazakhstan by the state. Firstly, laws and restrictions are increasingly imposed on independent media and journalist groups. The Freedom of house continuously reports on the frequent arrests and attacks on journalists, and accounts on the methods the states use to do so. This was evident through in 2012 the Ministry of culture and Information expanded powers to combat â<U+0080><U+0098>unofficial or negative informationâ<U+0080><U+0099> about any crisis. Moreover judges, who are exposed to constant corruption, have shut down independent television channels, news website and newspapers based, on the grounds of â<U+0080><U+0098>extremismâ<U+0080><U+0099>. Secondly, the rights of freedom of religion have become increasingly supressed over time. Despite freedom of religion being enshrined in the constitution, in 2005 the government outlawed organisations if they were considered â<U+0080><U+0098>extremismâ<U+0080><U+0099>; however, this evidently includes any groups that are not the mainstream religions. Nazarbayev has achieved much economic success due to energy ties with Europe, China and Russia. During the time period I have examined and this largely contributes to their positive ties with the Europe despite the major human rights abuses. Over half of Kazakhstanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s total trade today is with the European Union; in 2013 an estimated $53.4 billion was generated through this. Kazakhstanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s foreign policy included energy ties with China, which continued to expand its oil and gas pipeline network in Central Asia. Since the 2000â<U+0080><U+0099>s Kazakhstanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s economy has grown rapidly and this has reflected a stable economic society, where unemployment is rare. This has helped the Nazarbayev government to gain legitimacy, as the country although suffers from problems with distribution, does not have high poverty rates. This brings in the notion that authoritarian governments are able to maintain power more easily for long periods of time, if people have acceptable living standards. Nazarbayevâ<U+0080><U+0099>s long reign suggests there is some truth to this. Furthermore, despite the arguable increasingly worse human rights abuses in Kazakhstan, the country has reasonable good relations with the European Union. These relations arise from foreign investment deals, attributed to the vast resources in Kazakhstan. It is clear that the authoritarian regime held by Nazarbayev is able to monopolise power through corrupting the governmental system. Furthermore, he increasingly is placing restrictions on civil liberties. However, his success economically has avoided any major upheaval from the public and from the international arena. The evidence above, which allowed me to answer the questions confidently, was easily found and not largely disputed among my sources.

To get my answers for the questions above i used websites such as freedomhouse and similar but also got information from news articles. I found it some what difficult to answer some questions as sometimes they would clash with other answers. For example, i know that people over the age of 18 can vote in their elections, but i also read that women are 'valued' only half as much as men. That bit made me wonder more about voting. Voting is relatively free in Iran but there are some restrictions and barriers. Candidates must first be approved by the council of guardians and the president has to be appointed by the supreme leader. I got this information from the CIA fact book. With who can vote, i answered that any Iranian citizen over 18 can. I was a little hesitant with this answer as i know that men and women are not really equal in the country. There are opposition parites in Iran but again, anyone who run has to firt be approved by the council of guardians. Some parties are also banned in the country. The media in Iran is censored and only approved material is allowed, though there are privately owned media companies, there are restrictions on how they can run. Corruption is a big issue in Iran, but mostly on the lower level. There are sometimes breaches higher up but that is stamped out quickly with investigations. There is not much freedom in Iran as there are heavy restrictions on the people with religious, ethinc and gender issues being the biggest. The courts are based on Islamic law and the judiciary has to be approved by the supreme leader. The sumpreme leader has most of the power and makes most of the decisions but can be removed by the council of experts.",2,0,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,1,4,1,7,4,11

Section 42 of the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana - http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/republic/constitution.php?id=Gconst7.html Is there an effective opposition and is there a possibility for it to be elected to govern? Yes, historically party transitions have occurred multiple times in Ghana and are cited to have been effective due to 'an independent Electoral Commission and transparent electoral processes, integration of the political elite alongside the creation of norms and institutions structuring elite behaviour, and the institutionalization of political parties.' Transitions have occurred between different popular parties such as the NPP and NDC.

There does exist some inherent institutional discrimination against particular demographics; eg: women, particular religions, lower socio-economic class in attaining political power. For example; in 2007 women only held 10% of the roles of governance in local Ghana. These factors are largely derived from cultural influence rather than the structuring of government itself.

Though it does possess the same constitutional elements as many other contemporary democracies in asserting the separation of power and rule of law, the Ghanaian executive has had multiple cases of abuses/select uses of power in executing law. Issues around which laws in particular are passed and the passing of executive pardons raises questions around the effectiveness of the rule of law in Ghana.

Ghana's judiciary is arguably more independent than most in that it possesses autonomy in the preparation, administration, and control of its own budget. However, whether or not this actualizes into a fair judiciary is debated.

Since the democratisation of Ghana in 1992, initiatives such as the 'Peoples'Assembly'concept - a platform for citizens to interact with the executive President on a one-on-one basis - have emerged to increase. An annually held public forum, the Peoples'Assembly is designed to allow the executive explain its policies to the people, and respond to questions from the public on key issues. In addition to this, the Ghanaian judiciary - like that of New Zealand's and other contemporary democracies - possesses sufficient political independence so as to be able to hold the executive accountable for significant breaches of fundamental rights and freedoms.

Significant government markers demonstrate that Ghana has accomplished a notable advance in recent years as far as government viability, transparency of the administrative system and control of corruption are concerned. In any case, despite the fact that it not as prevalent as in most other African nations, corruption remains a huge issue in the nation. Small-scale corruption consistently emerges as an issue and there is evidence of types of political corruption including misuse and taking of state resources. Corruption affects sectors such as the police force, political gatherings, and management of public finances - specifically concerning taxation and customs administration. With the recent discovery of offshore oil fields, the country's past record in managing its mineral wealth has raised concerns over its ability to manage oil revenues transparently. The government has a strong anti-corruption legal framework in place, but faces challenges of enforcement. The creation of anti-corruption institutions such as the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice, the Serious Fraud Office, and the Public Procurement Authority acted to reduce its prevalence in Ghana. The Serious Fraud Office has recently been replaced by the Economic and Organised Crime Office with additional powers to investigate and prosecute corruption cases. Despite this, recommendations are being made to significantly extend the powers of these bodies so as to adequately prevent corruption further developing in the country Political Context Study-Ghana - Abdul Gafaru Abdulai - http://www.polis.leeds.ac.uk/assets/files/research/research-projects/abdulai-ghana-political-context-study-jan09.pdf OVERVIEW OF CORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION IN GHANA - 22 February 2011 - Transparency International - http://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/271_Corruption_and_anti_corruption_in_Ghana.pdf",3,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,2,4,2,13,12,25

"Benin",1995,2005,"""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","Benin, currently is one of Africa's most stable democracy's. But it is still heavily corrupt, not so much politically but it is heavily underdeveloped and corruption is rife. Economically Benin is struggling which leads to more issues within the country such as education and health supplies not being available. During the time period that I have chosen 1995- 2005 Benin was going through some strong positive political changes, changes that were making the government more transparent. But although Benin has a strong democracy it was also on thin ice due to the state being incredibly corrupt. During this time period as well Benin was experiencing a large amount of refugees flooding in from neighbouring countries that they didn't have the facilities or economy to deal with, which lead to a larger problem of Benin having to borrow money to support these people. Because of Benin's placement in Africa and its neighbouring countries being quite corrupt it is difficult to develop Benin when corruption is quite high and the government is under threat from the civilians of the state. So although politically Benin is not corrupt, culturally and within society it is. I found this difficult when answering some of the questions because it's not a stable democracy if it could be under potential threat. Benin adopted a new constitution in 1990 in order to open up and liberalise the political system and economy. Its chief aims were to enshrine in law accountability, transparency, and freedom of religion, freedom of the press, separation of governmental powers, the right to strike, universal suffrage and independence of the judiciary. Mathieu Kérékou, was President of Benin from 1972 to 1991 and again from 1996 to 2006. After seizing power in a military coup, he ruled the country for 17 years, for most of that time under an officially Marxist-Leninist ideology, before he was stripped of his powers by the National Conference of 1990. He was defeated in the 1991 presidential election, but was returned to the presidency in the 1996 election and controversially re-elected in 2001 . The fact that it was seen as suspicious that Mathieu was re-elected because of his Marxist approach makes the state look very corrupt, which made it difficult to answer a few questions because it's unknown if it was a genuine election at the time or if it was planned. Although he did then take a democratic view on the state and put some beneficial policies in place.

"Bahrain",1999,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Emir Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa had ruled Bahrain for 38 years when he died on the 6 th of March, 1999. Kofi Annan of the UN described him as 'a force for stability' within the Middle East. [1] Emir Isa had, in fact, been an exceedingly passive, ceremonial ruler. He had paid little heed to the politics and divides within his nation even throughout the turbulent 'intifada' uprisings of the 1990s. The government had been effectively maintained by Bahrain's first and only Prime Minister, Emir Isa's younger brother, Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa. The late Emir was succeeded by his son, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa. Emir Hamad, whose title was changed to King in 2002, clearly intended to be a much more active ruler than his father. So began a process of liberalisation, with economic goals underlying the change in direction. [2] Bahrain was running out of oil, and it was turning to financial services and Gulf tourism. [3] It occurred to King Hamad that a traditionalist policy, based in a reliance on a single export, was not going to be successful in the future. It is important to note that tied very closely to Bahrain's political landscape and levels of corruption in this period is the sectarian divide within the country. The majority of Bahrain, 70%, is Shiite, the Khalifa family is Sunni. Poverty levels are highest amongst the Shiite population. [4] I have been selective in terms of the time period for my research. It spans from the death of Emir Isa to immediately before the sudden surge of unrest and instability of the Arab Spring. My reasons for excluding the Arab Spring period from my data input is based on the fact that the interactions between the government and the populace after late 2010 were quite different and more extreme than in the ten years prior, so may have provided unrepresentative or erratic results. In 2001, the National Action Charter was passed through referendum initiating a bicameral legislature. [5] Before this, the unelected Shura Council had maintained full legislative power. The new structure kept the appointed Shura Council as the upper house and introduced an elected Council of Representatives as the lower house. The Council of Representatives was initially expressed as being the sole source of law in Bahrain, with the Shura Council simply acting as an executive branch and setting the legislative agenda. However, in 2002, behind closed doors, the government amended the Charter giving the Shura Council equal law-making power and the power of veto over the Council of Representatives. The opposition was not consulted. Voter turnout in the first election for the Council of Representatives was reported as 53.4%. [6] As of 2010, approximately half of the cabinet ministers were members of the Al-Khalifa family. The most important ministries especially were allotted to the Khalifas. [7] Opposition parties had a very limited platform upon which to operate, mainly due to institutional constraints. They consistently boycotted the elections, stating that the Council of Representatives had no real power, with the executive maintaining absolute control over the passage of laws. [8] This created a vicious cycle, with the boycotts further limiting any potential representation of opposition groups in the Representative Council, especially as the opposition groups are largely separated along sectarian and religious lines. There was simply no means for the opposition to gain a foothold that might lead to substantive power. Even if opposition parties accessed the Council of Representatives its powers were simply not enough to allow for truly representative law-making. Bahrain remained a repressive state even whilst King Hamad tried to instigate such political reforms. With the legislative reform initiated in 2002 there came a heightened level of confidence amongst the opposition movements, even having boycotted the Representative Council elections. In February of 2004 a conference was organised aimed at discussing the structure of a truly democratic, social contract constitution. [9] The hotel that was hosting was heavily pressured to cancel the event and foreign guests were refused entry into the country. Later that year the opposition drafted a petition for the changes to be made to the constitution. Seventeen signature collectors were arrested. The leader of the political NGO the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, made a speech that same year calling for the resignation of Sheikh Khalifa, the Prime Minister. [10] He was then arrested and the BCHR was dissolved and dubbed a terrorist organisation. In 2005, moderators of the Bahrain Online website were arrested for allegedly defaming the government. [11] Throughout this period internet usage was restricted with the Ministry of Information having full capacity to block any websites of their choosing. [12] Both Freedom House and Reporter Without Borders rate the press within Bahrain as 'not free', with wide reports of government agents applying rules as to what can and cannot be published and checking publications before release for anti-establishment material. In line with many autocratic governments the Bahrain constitution does not coalesce with reality, promising liberties distinctly separate from those in practice. Members of the judiciary are nominated by the Minister of Justice, with the Prime Minister then decreeing their appointment if he so wills it. [13] King Hamad chairs the Supreme Judicial Council who makes appointments for the constitutional court. High-ranking judges are predominantly members of the royal family or have personal or economic ties to the royal family. [14] The power that the royal family holds is furthered by the overlap within the judiciary. There is no separation of powers or realistic potential for judicial checks on the exercise of power. The Court of Cassation, Bahrain's highest appellate court, also wholly consists of judges appointed and removed by royal decree. [15] In 2006, the Al Bandar report was released by the Gulf Centre for Democratic Development, a clear example of corruption at the executive level. [16] It contained allegations that leading members of the government and royal family had organised a scheme to foment the sectarian divide within Bahrain. It claimed that the Minister of Cabinet Affairs financed the operation that organised spying on Shiites, establishing government organised non-governmental organisations, election rigging, and inciting hatred online. The 'Bandargate' report is but one example of the alleged corruption at the highest levels of Bahraini government, especially as relates to the sectarian divide within the country. More recently, it has come to light that one of the Prime Ministers foremost advisors Sheikh Isa bin Ali Al-Khalifa reportedly took bribes of up to $6 million from a British-Canadian businessman between 2003 and 2004. [17] Instances such as this, in addition to damning reports from various international NGOs all point to widespread governmental corruption, even before considering the Transparency International data that will form the basis of the corruption element of this study.

Also parties are free to set up provided that they follow a few rules and such, such as no extremist groups. This was also reassured by an article. I assumed this information was the same as it would have been in the 90s because of the fact that the same party that was ruling is currently ruling, ALSO, there have been no major policy changes in terms of structure of civil society and government Question 5: Hooghe, Marc, and Koen Pelleriaux.

There was a case where Socialist Andre Cools was gaining popularity amongst the Belgium left, being assassinated for his growing criticism of Capitalism and exposing of fraudulent parliamentary practices in the country.

"Armenia",1998,2008,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Q. 1, 2 & 3 Around the administered year of 2006, I have used the years 1998 and 2008 as inclusive boundary points to limit my period of study. These dates coincide with Robert Kocharyan's ascension to the presidency and subsequent mandatory relinquishment 10 years later, after the conclusion of his second five year term in power. The extent of this period affords us the ability to examine the regime in its entirety, as during Kocharyan's decade in power few seismic political or social reformations occured which suggested the Armenian political landscape was anything but consistent. There is no need to further limit the scope of analysis as to accurately classify the regime we must consider it over its full trajectory, rather than an isolated portion. Q. 4 Armenia transistioned to democratic rule in a 1991 election, after regaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. However, the state has struggled to instill due academic process and integrity - with the apperently democratic elections acting as one of the main problems. The 1998 and 2003 elections, both of which Kocharyan won, were widely disputed by the opposition and critized internationally. John Brady Kiesling's statistical review of electoral fraud during the 1998 Armenian election drew on data released conditionally by the Armenian Central Election Commission (as obligated to the International Foundation for Electoral Commision, to encourage honest democratisation of elections), finding significant numerical abberations suggesting systematic interference. According to Kiesling's data, the election CEC spreadsheets contained numerous errors, missing data and obvious transpositions - or terminated data where transpositions were unfeasible (Kiesling, undated) . Kiesling elaborates on these inconsistencies, reporting that local leaders 'deliver as close as possible to 100% of the possible votes to the expected winner.' In Armenia, voter turnout this high is implausible, and electoral roles list thousands of emigrants who do not return to vote. This heavily implies active fraud - namely invalidation of opposition ballots and ballot-stuffing - as observed by OSCE election attendees. The OSCE itself concluded that 'there was a lack of sufficient political determination by the authorities to ensure a fair and honest process' (OSCE, 2003) . Similar suspicions were voiced following the 2003 election, in which defeated opponent Stepan Demirchyan accused Kocharyan of electoral fraud - inciting extensive violent protests as a result. Therefore, whilst there are elections for the executive and legislure, these elections have minimal potential to change the regime as fraud is too prevalent and powerful. Q. 5 As per the CIA World Fact Book, Armenia had universal suffrage over the age of 18 during the studied period (CIA, 2015) . Q. 6 Despite Kocharyan's political dominance over an entire decade, and the subsequent ascendency to the presidency of the candidate he advocated after the conclusion of his two terms in power, there were significant opposition movements during his regime's rule. This is evidenced by the fact that, in the 2003 presidential election, the opposition managed to force a second round of voting as the results of the first round proved inconclusive (Babayan, 2015) . Sufficient evidence exists to suggest that Kocharyan's regime engaged in active electoral fraud (as previously discussed), making the results all the more impressive as, most likely, the opposition support was so strong that it would have been undeniably fraudulent to claim victory after a single round of voting - hence a second round was called in an attempt to grant the proceedings the appearance of validity and plausibility. The resulting protests also indicated extensive, commited opposition support. Despite conditonal aid from the US and EU, and warnings from the OSCE and CoE, legislative process was undermined by illegal actions in an attempt to avoid defeat - granted false veracity from a newly introduced elections law (Babayan 2015) . This suggested that the Kocharyan regime's main priority in governance was re-election, regardless of whether it was democratically licit or not, as they were willing to risk international ire and loss of benefits to achieve their goal. This gave the opposition an extremely low likelihood of being elected. The classification model is unfortunately ill-fitting for this particular circumstance, as none of the options fit correctly. The opposition was significant, however had no real chance for it to gain power. The framework assumes that only oppositions that lack significant support similarly lack the ability to gain power, however in situations where fraud is as inherent a factor in electoral process as it is in Kocharyan's Armenia then even strong opposition cannot feasibly achieve power without support outside domestic politics (international intervention or military backing) . Despite this slight incongruousness, the model is broad enough that the classification can roughly fit. To say that the opposition is miniscule or unheard from would be untrue, however to say that the opposition only has a miniscule chance of gaining power would still technically be accurate, as 'low likelihood' would encompass the complete lack of true likelihood, and thus this classification is most apt of those offered. Q. 7 Active political power and agency is, in reality, mostly restricted to the president and his regime. The guise of democracy and free and fair elections are a smokescreen for presidential manipulation and monopolisation of political power. As previously discussed, Armenian elections during the rule of President Robert Kocharyan were largely fraudulent and had little potential to determine with whom power should lie. Elections are the primary conduit through which the general populace can exert their political power in a meaningful way, however if elections are lack the capability to produce regime change, then the average citizen loses any political power and ability to influence governance. Access to political power under Kocharyan, therefore, is limited only to those either in power (the Kocharyan regime) or those who can help sustain the regime's political omnipotence. The power structure was manipulated in a strictly top-down manner, where power is able to breed power. This is exemplified in, again, the elections - in which the incubent received three times as much media coverage as the opposition candidates combined; which is a clear violation of the electoral code (Babayan, 2015) . Due to this imbalanced power structure, in reality those who are already politically elite have monopolise the majority of the majority of political power and block access to those less powerful. Q. 8 Just as the Armenian media was manipulated to advance Kocharyan's political ambitions by biasing media coverage, the distortion of the media's integity was motivated by the intent to minimalise public criticism of the regime and to reflect the regime's agenda. Primarily, multiple cases of extreme violence against critical journalists were carried out under Kocharyan's rule, engendering a media environment in which self-censorship became normalised due to fears of violent repression media outlets spoke out against the regime (Grigoryan, 2009) . The diminishing of Armenia's media as a free and fair institution was exacerbated by lawful decrees. Libel was only decriminalised in 2010 (OSCE, 2013), two years after Kocharyan ceded his power. In 2006, legislation was approved to limit the coverage of terrorism, with Kocharyan citing the fear of attacks as justification. The legislation itself was vague and could easily be manipulated to extend restrictions beyond its original intent (Freedom House, 2006) . Therefore, not only was media repression implicit it was also institutional. The intimidating power of the regime, backed with its legislative authority, ensured that the Armenian media was neither free or able to act as a check and balance on power. Q. 9 A NATO review of Armenia's constitution and separation of powers concluded that power in Armenia is extremely centralised, and in particular the President has powerful leverages over the judicial branch due to contemporary legislation (NATO, 1998) . As discussed in response to question 11, this power is exemplified by the president's ability to appoint and dismiss judges (Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum, 2008) . This implies the judiciary is not independant. Having stripped the voting public of their political power via electoral fraud, and ensuring the judiciary is not independent, the executive has no effective political obligation to uphold the rule of the law. This is evidenced in the fraudulent elections, where Kocharyan breached electoral legislation despite warnings from transnational union organisations. Power is not necessarily wielded arbitrarily however, as the regime at least attempted to justify their moves in legislative terms and avoided absolute tyranny. And yet, the executive clearly was not subject to the rule of the law. Q. 10 Human rights in Armenia under Kocharyan were frequently restricted both institutionally and through social coercion. Abuses towards rights of assembly were perhaps the most egregious, reflecting the regimes priority of retaining power. As per political academic Neil Babayan, legislative restrictions on the right to hold peaceful demonstrations were imposed in 2000/01 (Babayan, 2015) . In 2008, public transport was suspended in the capital Yerevan, in a thinly-veiled effort to minimise attendance at a planned opposition rally (Shoghikian, 2008) . These examples demonstrate how the Kocharyan regime utilised various methods of restriction - both legislative and systematic - to effectively restrict the civil rights of the populace. His rule also cultivated a landscape in which speaking out against domestic violence was considered taboo, and many womens rights activists received death threats (Human Rights Watch, 2010) . Therefore, whilst the regime did not actively suppress women's rights, it did sustain a society in which such injustices were prevalent and cannot be absolved of accountability. Furthermore, the attacks on critical journalists further indicated a lack of institutional respect for basic human rights - violating rights to freedom of speech by attempting to control the media and suppress criticism Therefore, while human rights were available, they were regularly abused when the exercising of these rights were detrimental to the consolidation of regime power. The regime also did little to correct previous injustices. Q. 11 As previously discussed, there is little separation between the executive and the judiciary. Indepence is therefore implausible, as it is extremely unlikely the judiciary would make rulings at the detriment of the executive as the leverage they hold is likely too great. For example, with regards to the power of the Coucil of Justice, the President has the power to appoint as judges 'candidates acceptable to him.' Also, a judge who ruled against the tax authority was removed. With inseparable executive power within the judiciary, independent process is impossible. The Armenian judiciary also faces significant obstacles to becoming fair, as the ombudsman reveals that bribes are commonplace. Karen Andreasyan, the lawyer who headed the ombudsman investigation, contends that bribes range from roughly $500 to $50,000 USD - or 10% of the cost of lawsuits (Cassin, 2013) . As the judiciary, and relating legislation, existed during Kocharyan's rule - combined with the country's pervasive corruption - an independent and fair judiciary was a largely unachievable ideal. Q. 12 Few effective institutions existed to check and balance Kocharyan's power. An ombudsman existed (known as the Human Rights Defender), one which was purported to 'have free access to any state institution or organisation' according to parliament legislation (Kocharyan, 2003) . However, as the referenced legislation is one enacted by Kocharian himself, it is unsurprising that in effect the ombudsman lacked that power and authority. According to political analyst Simon Payaslian, the Human Rights Defender had no real legally-binding power to truly protect the citizens' human rights, and as an organisation was disorganised and inefficient. Combined with a corrupt and non-independent judiciary, few barriers stood between Kocharyan and true personal rule. Any checks and balances that existed were ineffective, and their bloated existence to appease international institutions and powers blocked the path of any efficient and effective models being instituted. As the classification discerns, such institutions can only be considered as 'checks and balances' if they are actually effective rather than merely existing, and thus in Armenia between 1998 and 2008 there were none. Q. 13 Kocharyan's regime had little cultural agenda. However two minority groups - the Yazidis and Jehovah's Witnesses - were systematically repressed. The Jehovah's Witnesses were seen by the government as a threat to the Armenian Apostilic Church and persecuted them as a result - preventing them from registering as a religious group and incarcerating members for refusing to serve in the military (US Department of State, 2009) . The Yazidis - a race of religious refugees - faced regular military hazing, poor police response rates to crime and high rates of poverty (US DoS, 2009) . Therefore, whilst minorities largely share the same rights as the majority of the populace, their rights are often restricted for various discriminatory reasons despite their equal statutory rights. This conclusion fits the classification mode well. Q. 14 I feel significantly assured in my classifications, as not only have I exacted extensive research from a broad range of reputable sources, I have also minimised the number of assumptions made to ensure my contentions are based fully in historical fact. However, I hesitate from marking myself as being absolutely confident, as I understand that there is always the potential for certain important information to be lost or skewed over time. There is always the potential for error. Q. 15 & 16 As previously discussed, the Armenian judiciary is corrupted - both from above (lack of independence from the executive) and below (bribery) . As well as this, however, there is evidence of severe mis-appropriation of public resources. In a 2008 investigation by journalist Ararat Davtyan, it was uncovered that tracts of land had been expropriated by the government under public domain laws. This land, however, was unjustly granted to an employee under the guise of an 'eminent domain' (Davtyan, 2008) . This revelation implies a further two kinds of corruption in the Armenian government; misuse of public resources by top officials, and special privileges granted to politically-connected people. While there is sufficient evidence to imply corruption at the state and official level, there is a lack sufficient information to discern whether this corruption extends further down the political structure. While the assumption that it does would not be unfounded or unlikely, my philosophy regarding this regime classification is to minimise the amount of assumptions made, and claims which lack significant evidence. Therefore, we may only conlude that these three types of corruption existed under Kocharyan, and that they occured only at certain levels of the regime structure, however concede that further corruption could feasibly have occurred at a number of state and civil levels.

"Sudan",2003,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Political Rights 1, I gave Sudan the classification of free voting because while everyone is entitled to vote, it is hard for opposition parties to appear legitimate and compete with the ruling National Congress Party. As it has formed a government with the second largest party in the country, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, it is virtually unbeatable. However there is no chance another party could win and take power, as there are huge restrictions on the public space opposition can occupy during and leading up to elections (US State Dep.) There are also reported large polling irregularities and the European Union has refused to monitor elections. One could not call these elections fair. Political Rights 2, Universal suffrage exists for all Sudanese nationals over the age of 17 (ACRLI) Political Rights 3, it is legal to form opposition parties following 2000 legislation, with 72 registering for the 72 elections. However political clout lies with the NCP, and ruling elites in the capital city of Khartoum. Military power lies with the SPLM, which allied itself with the NCP (Minority Rights) . Other minor parties have no hope of being elected due to their marginalisation, and if they were then interference with the results would prevent them from taking power (US State Dep.) Political Rights 4, as mentioned above, only those within the Khartoum elite can rise to power, which on itself entails having considerable wealth and political social connections, which is why I chose this answer Political Rights 5, the interim constitution guarantees freedom of speech. However according to Freedom House reporters practice self-censorship and can face harassment for criticism of the government, In 2006 a journalist was found mysteriously dead after being charged with blasphemy. Universities also practice self-censorship in the same manner. Civil Liberties 1, It is clear that the state commits atrocities in such as during the Darfur conflict (BBC) there is also high level corruption throughout the state and police, meaning crimes are committed on a daily basis. It is also classified by US State department reports as a state sponsor of terroism Civil Liberties 2, People legal have these rights but not in practice, most greatly infringed upon is freedom of speech, as the government retains the majority of hard power so organised resistance is not such a concern, however if the government did decide to oppose a group or peoples mobility, then they are fully capable of doing so. This is in part inferred, as they have no independent judiciary. There are also confirmed cases of slavery in Sudan, and the leader and state have been found by the International Criminal Court to be guilty of war crimes. Women also have very little rights and representation in Sudan, and are restricted to where they can go and who with. Civil Liberties 3, legally the judiciary is free, however in practice it is appointed by the ruling elites (ACRLI) Civil Liberties 4, the elites have the power to do as they wish, however the coalition with the SPLM means that there are some checks. However in general corruption is widespread throughout the bureaucracy. Civil Liberties 5, there are laws I could find to protect minorities, as already mentioned, women are discriminated against, and much of the conflict historically in Sudan has come from conflict with minorities, be it race, religion, or culture. It is a very divisive nation. (BBC) (Freedom House) It is clear there is much corruption in Sudan across all levels, businesses find it hard to begin here due to the incredibly high cost of paying your way in to any area. Many investigators in corruption have been exiled from the country, and NGOs working on stopping it are prevented from doing work within the country. It is hard to find academic work on it as it appears it is prevented before it can actually be studied and written.

"Guatemala",1998,2006,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Guatemala Justification In 1996 Guatemala's civil war ended after three decade of conflict. The state was responsible for the vast majority of human rights abuses during the war and arguably committed genocide against the Mayan population. Following the war, a return to democracy took place, but the new democratic regime was beset with corruption and violence. 2-3. The years 1998-2006 have been chosen for research because two transitions in government occurred as a result of elections during this period whilst corruption remained widespread. 4. Guatemala received three points because elections in these years were 'meaningful' and 'fraud free' (Jon Moran, Crime and Corruption in New Democracies, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. p.119) . The 1999 election was 'largely free and fair' according to Freedom House. Changes of government are likely following elections in Guatemala. However, during the 2003 election there was some violence from supporters of a previous dictator General Efrain Rios Montt, but not enough to constitute significant barriers to the opposition gaining power (The Economist Intelligence Unit, Guatemala Politics: Oscar Night, New York: 2004) . 5. Guatemala had universal suffrage at 18 with the exception of members of the military and police who must remain at bunkers during elections, and as such receives two points. (CIA World Fact Book, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html ) . 6. There was effective opposition in Guatemala who regularly form governments as demonstrated in the transitions of power after the 1999 election where Portillo gained the Presidency and the 2003 election where Berger became president. As will be discussed later, media can be influenced in favour of the government, but this did not prevent opposition achieving victory. I have given them 3 though a 2.5 would have been more suitable option. 7. Guatemala received two points for the level of access its citizens have to political power. Guatemala did not fit the criteria for 1 point as many people do have effective access to power, but 2 points is overly generous, 1.5 would have been more suitable. In Guatemala there were no formal restrictions on access to power, but patriarchy and illiteracy led to serious disadvantages for women and indigenous peoples in utilising political power (Roman Krznarichtt, United Nations Human Development Report, 2005 http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2005_krznaric_roman_17.pdf also Nineth Montenegro, The Challenge of Women's Political Participation in Guatemala, Sweden:2002, www.idea.int/publications/wip/upload/montenegro-CS-Guatemala.pdf ) . 8. Guatemala received one point because much media is privately owned and independent from the state, but prone to political influence. Journalists looking into human rights issues frequently received death threats and intimidation from the State and parallel power structures (Freedom House 2002, https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2002/guatemala#.VV5Rlvmqqkp ) . 9. Guatemala receives one point because the rule of Law was 'severely undermined' by the Judiciary's lack of independence and chronic corruption (Freedom House 1998, https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/1998/guatemala#.VV6CnPmqqkp ) . The President admitted that the 20,000-strong police were 'infiltrated by organised crime,' and there are 100,000 privately employed security workers who operate without regulation (Moran, p.122. also The Economist Intelligence Unit, Guatemala Politics: Impunity Rules, New York: 2006) . 10. Guatemala has received one point as citizens in this regime have access to fundamental human rights, but there is sometimes suppression and violence is common. People were freely able to form political parties and have constitutional rights, but violence from military, police, private security, gangs and 'death squads' lead to mistreatment of peasants and a climate of fear where rights are frequently breached by the state or other parties (Moran p.127. also The Economist, Guatemala Politics: Impunity Rules ) . 11. Guatemala's judiciary was plagued by corruption and manipulation by the State and criminal groups. If something reflects badly on the State it was not investigated, for example, military and General Rios Mont were not held to account for their actions in the civil war in these years ( Impunity Rules ) . Moran maintains that criminals were rarely brought to justice and that the judiciary is not effectively independent. Guatemala receives 0 points, not just for State interference in the judiciary but also that of criminal parallel power structures. 12. I have given Guatemala two points for this section. The judiciary had no role in holding the governing regime to account. Opposition in congress did not appear to be meaningfully hold the government to account in these years. Guatemala had an ombudsman but their role in these years is not clearly visible in sources ( Inter-American Development Bank, 2005 http://www.iadb.org/en/projects/project-description-title,1303.html?id=GU-T1017 ) . In Guatemala non-government organisations aided in holding the governing regimes to account, such as the office of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights (Human Rights Watch, 2010, http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2010/guatemala ) . 13. Guatemala receives one point. Despite minority groups gaining a statutory right in the indigenous Indian language becoming used in courtrooms, they barely featured in the nations police force recruits (Freedom House 2005) . Indigenous people who frequently come from rural or more impoverished backgrounds were often politically disenfranchised due to location or illiteracy. 14. I am confident in my research as I found much quality material from Freedom House, the Economist and published academics. 15. All sources agree that corruption was pervasive and endemic in Guatemala. The President admitted to corruption in the Police involved in drug crime, Moran draws attention to the corruption of the 'higher slopes of power' such as the judiciary, central government and institutions who protect the military, elites and organised crime. Transparency International's Corruption Perception index 2005 awarded the country a low rating of 2.5/10, indicating widespread perceptions of corruption ( http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/cpi_2005 ) . 16. The aforementioned sources describe each of the selected forms of corruption being perpetrated by groups and individuals at the high and low levels.",3,2,3,3,1,1,1,0,2,1,5,0,12,5,17
"Belarus",1990,2000,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","When conducting my research for Belarus I choose 1990 as my starting year as it was when Belarus declared state sovereignty. This is important as it pinpoints a subconscious move to democratic measures, however it is important to note that Belarus had strong ties with Russia and therefore Russia had some influence in the government workings of the state. The main reference year is 1995 as it was when the first parliamentary elections took place. The actions by those in power particularly influenced my answers to the Political Rights and Civil Liberties questions. The final point of reference was 2000 as I wanted to look at 5 years prior to 1995 and after, but mainly focusing on 1995. When determining the answers for these questions I looked at the Transparency International Corruption Index as well as a US report on Belarus in 1995 (found here: http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/democracy/1995_hrp_report/95hrp_report_eur/Belarus.html) POLITICAL RIGHTS: 'Political Rights 1: Are there free and fair elections for this state's executive and legislature?' For this question I looked at the main example of elections in the decade of research and this was the 1995 elections. The 1995 elections can be deemed to have been very limited as the government heavily restricted the ability of other parties to advertise candidates and their ideologies of what they would do if they got into power. The International community did not view the elections as free and fair and ultimately four referendums took place in order to get the parliament to resemble an acceptable structure. However, all voting was influenced as a result I gave the answer of: '1 point: There are elections for the executive and the legislature but there is a very low likelihood of government change via elections.' as there was influence on the general public and very little information offered regarding other parties in the election, the Government also engaged in a lot of propaganda to channel the voting of the public. 'Political Rights 2: Does this country allow universal suffrage?' For this Question I answered: '2 points: The majority of people in this country are able to vote. However, there are minor restrictions because of things such as age or incarceration, etc.' I answered this as generally everyone in the public from the information I looked at was able to vote including women as long as they were over 18 and were not incarcerated. 'Political Rights 3: Is there an effective opposition and is there a possibility for it to be elected to govern?' The opposition parties in this period were so downplayed and had no opportunity to advertise and make themselves, as well as their ideologies known, that the opposition parties were not effective as a whole nor was there a possibility for them to govern. Public awareness was heavily limited and the smear campaigns that were being initiated meant that I answered: 1 point: There is an opposition, however its numbers are minuscule and often never heard from. There is no chance for it to gain power.' This process of elections means that there is no chance of political shift and implies a corrupt state. 'Political Rights 4: Do all people have effective access to political power?' The Government allows anyone to have access to political power, although gender is a restriction as there are fewer opportunities for women to get involved regardless of the fact that they earn equal pay to men. Although the government allows anyone access to political power the amount of political power is debateable purely due to the influence and the tactics initiated in the 1995 elections. Hence why the following answer was involved: '2 points: Many people have access to political power, with some exceptions.' 'Political Rights 5: Is there a free, independent and well-resourced media that is able to act as a check and balance on power?' The government in this time period maintained the idea of a 'free media' however, the government owns all of the publishing and news corporations. This restricts the medias ability to be able to place checks on power as anything that is printed is heavily censored by government involvement, from the research it is also noted that slandering the government was an offense. This is why this question was given the following answer: '1 point: Independent media may exist, but there is heavy censorship, self-censorship or government intervention in editorial processes.' CIVIL LIBERTIES: 'Civil Liberties 1: Does this regime uphold the rule of law?' The regime seems to take the law and adapt it in a way that benefits those in charge more, although they do uphold a majority of the law some of it is manipulated or ignored to a certain extent. This can be seen through my answers for the political rights section and therefore influenced my answer here: '2 points: The rule of law is generally upheld, but notable and significant breaches do occur.' 'Civil Liberties 2: Do all citizens within this regime have access to fundamental human rights, including: Freedom of Assembly and Association; Freedom of Speech and Expression; Freedom of Mobility? ' All of these civil liberties in the time period were heavily restricted as discussed in the US report on Belarus. The report outlined the government's views and how these impacted the individuals in society. 'Civil Liberties 3: Does this country have a free, independent and fair judiciary?' Due to the information provided this question and the one below were educated guesses as all the evidence contemplated pointed at the fact that Belarus did not have a free, independent and fair judiciary. 'Civil Liberties 4: Does this country have effective processes in order to hold the governing regime accountable? These could be measures such as independent Ombudsman, inquiries, parliamentary question time, an upper house of parliament, select committees, etc. These processes must have some real effectiveness, not just exist on paper.' This question was also an educated guess as the actions that occurred in the 1995 elections and the way in which the government restricted behaviours in the general public made it very unlikely that there was anything in place to make the governing regime accountable. 'Civil Liberties 5: Does this country uphold the right to equal treatment and due process for minority groups?' It was established on the Human Rights report conducted on Belarus that the government had laws and fundamental practices put in place to help the minority groups in Belarus in this time period. The main reason I did not give it the full marks for this question was because that although there was equal pay for women, women's opportunities were restricted and it was incredibly hard for them to get into governmental positions. This restricted access to opportunities also meant that being a woman became a minority group. Another issue I had with this was that although there were laws in place for the disabled when the government had not put aside money to be able to alter public buildings to allow for easier access. The government encouraged equal treatment of minority groups however it has some flaws, which meant I gave it, the following answer: '2 Points: There are legal and statutory rights, but there is active social and procedural discrimination and inequality towards groups or minorities, such as over-representation in the criminal justice system and electoral systems which lock minority groups out of power.' CONCLUSION: Belarus has a government that seemed to manipulate the laws in order to benefit the officials and made it incredibly hard to develop any form of opposition rendering the elections that took place in 1995 particularly useless as many voters did not even know that there were any other parties in the election as they couldn't campaign. Belarus establishes itself as a corrupt country due to the government manipulation of laws, political restrictions and restrictions on the fundamental human rights.",1,2,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,2,0,7,5,12
"Chad",2001,2006,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Regime Period: 2001-2006 represent one Chadian Presidential term which I use to demarcate the regime period. It includes key events like an election of the National Assembly, two Presidential elections, a constitutional referendum, and a coup, aiding examination of civil and political rights in action to ascertain Chad's condition in order to classify it. Approach The first step was establishing whether or not each political or civil feature (e.g. elections) was present. If so, next was determining the condition of the feature (i.e. whether it's free, fair, independent etc.) and the degree of the condition (i.e. how effective or limited this feature is, the amount of people included, etc.) . It wasn't enough to establish the presence of governing process since it doesn't guarantee robust or proper practice so I utilized two types of information: the provisional, technical, law/policy-based and the evaluative, critical, report/news based. The former is useful to establish whether the features are present, and the possibility and some extent of their formal presence and practice. The latter is important to understand the reality of the practice of these provisions and whether, in actuality, they work effectively as intended. Both types were weighed and used evenly in the final calculation of each rating. Every section (labeled in this justification) includes supporting background information in justification of each answer. Sources All sources used in this research project are as credible as possible. The information attained from them is generally regime-period specific. Most sources dealt with the technical, formal processes, and were readily enough available. The issue was finding sources that dealt with the evaluative side of actual practice. Freedom House 'places a greater emphasis on whether these rights are implemented in practice' . They were a baseline for further independent research (as far as possible) with the African Elections Database, Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (E.I.S.A.), European Union, Global Edge (Michigan State University), Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (I.D.E.A.), Inter-Parliamentary Union, Knoema, Reporters Without Borders, and World Bank. Challenges Three key challenges during this project were source language, information limitation, and system terminology and definition. 1. Source Language: Many reports and Chadian news cites were solely in their official language, French, making it difficult to obtain information in English in order to understand and supplement other reputable sources. This was a barrier to research scope and understanding by limiting the extent of research. 2. Information Limitation: Though Chad has some degree of prominence as an African country it was difficult to find information/reports on the reality of civil liberties and political rights. While some sources like Freedom House and the European Union documented the condition of these regime features, it was hard to find additional supporting information. I suspect there isn't a great deal of literature surrounding Chadian civil liberties and political rights in readily accessible locations and forms, though there was information on technical procedures and policies. Further, it was difficult to find relevant information for the regime period since many sources started documentation from 2006/7 onward. Since Chad is an African country I believe in general there is a lack if literature that analyses African regimes, and those that do lack a breadth in coverage. 3. System Terminology and Definitions: Some terminology in the RCE was undefined; problematic since the quality of the answers depend on a clear understanding of what is being asked or is meant. Specific issues are further addressed under each individual section justification. To resolve this it would have been useful to have a glossary of key terms and their definitions -the main ones being 'free', 'fair' -and the scope of terms like 'universal suffrage' . For continuity, once terminology like 'free' were defined, I employed it consistently for subsequent use. Classification Summary According to this system Chad is semi-democratic, rating ­­15 out of 30. This is due to the presence of formal democratic institutions and process that function minimally but aren't effective and capacble of restraining power. Heavy corruption and misuse also contributes. Freedom House classed Chadian political rights and civil liberties unchangingly between 2001-2006, with Chad consistently rating 6 for political rights, 5 for civil liberties, and a freedom rating of 5.5, (with 7 as the worst for each) . These ratings, as an initial indicator, were fairly aligned with my own research. Technically between 2001-2006 at least, Chad was a republic and seemed to have many political institutions but there is a discrepancy between the Freedom House ranking and apparent formal republican 'democratic'process on paper. Additional research showed that the functions of political institutions that govern rights or check power, like media, judiciary, elections, were dysfunctional. The rule of law was often an excuse to inflict oppression and consolidate power. Chad definitely has oppression, particularly censorship, political terror, and the prevention of free association, undermining civil liberties. There are also many cases in which groups opposed to the state engage in political terror that undermines other freedoms. Definitions 'Free and fair'* is defined as per Levitsky and Way's understanding. 'Free'is when there is virtually no fraud or intimidation of voters (citizens), and 'fair'when opposition parties campaign on relatively even footing. (In relation to media and judiciary -free is the near absence of fraud or intimidation; fair is the nonpartisan nature of operation/action.) ( Source: 'Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes After the Cold War, Steven Levitsky and Luncan A. Way) 'Political power'is defined as 'the ability held by individuals and groups in a society that allows them to create and enforce policies for the community and manage public resources.' ( Source: http://study.com/academy/lesson/political-power-definition-types-sources.html ) POLITICAL RIGHTS Question 1 Chad has a plurality/majority [1] system with two elections, the National Assembly (elected from and proportional representation constituencies) and Presidential ( elected via an absolute majority) [2] . While there are many issues with accuracy of real turn out or coercive influencing factors, voter turnout is useful to begin with because no proper election has 100% turnout, but no functioning democracy has too low a turnout roughly below 40% (if so, legitimacy of the elected governing body is difficult to establish) . Voter turnout in 2001 Presidential elections was roughly 61.12%-61.37%. In 2002 National Assembly elections turnout was 52.04%, and 2006 Presidential elections had 53.08% turnout; indicating some genuine electoral activity [3] . Particularly interesting is that 'power has never changed hands through the ballot box in Chad, and previous elections which returned Deby to power in 1996 and 2001 were denounced as fraudulent by opposition leaders.' [4] There are processes for anti-corruption such as 'verified'demonstration that ballot boxes are empty and sealed; voter identification; voter's finger is marked with indelible ink; polling booths placed to shield the voters from observation during voting; and counting commencement at the polling station immediately after polling, observed by candidates and candidate agents. There is a ban on vote buying and on state resources being used in favour or against a political party or candidate. However, there is no data available regarding the need for reports on political finance in general or election-related finances, nor for such information to be made public, and there is no institution designated to receive reports [5] . There is no law or code of conduct governing election observers however Chad has an electoral code and electoral management body [6] . There are two Electoral Management Bodies, the Commission Electorale Nationale Indépendante (CENI; National Independent Electoral Commission) and the Constitutional Council (CC) . More here. The EU Observational report provided information on, and insight into, issues encountered in the 2001 Presidential elections such as election irregularities; restriction freedom of demonstration; restricting media freedom; political detainment/violence - Amnesty International documents excessive force by security forces including throwing tear gas canisters at the protesters, and six presidential candidates and some of their associates were briefly detained [7] ; and election fraud. The 2006 elections were the first in Chad with no participation by a major opposition candidate. Most political parties in Chad boycotted the elections in response to President Déby's decision to run for a third term. In 2005, a constitutional amendment scrapped the two-term limit, allowing Déby's third-term run. In the two elections past, there were 15 and seven candidates respectively, including some opposition heavyweights [8] . An attempted coup was made on 14 March 2006, but was put down by members of the army loyal to Déby. Critics said 'that with all key opposition leaders refusing to field candidates, the elections have become meaningless' ; 'many people say the polls will not be free and fair [9] . Conclusion: Though there are technical legal provisions for elections and their management, the reality of Chadian governance with election irregularities and violence, the conditions for free and fair transition of power weren't present. Further, that this is historically commonplace in Chad is highly indicative of the dysfunctionality of Chad's elections. Chad is rated 1 accordingly. ISSUE: The RCE didn't provide a definition for 'free' and 'fair' so I used Levitsky and Way's . and broadly employed it for subsequent uses. [1] http://www.idea.int/uid/countryview.cfm?id=213#Electoral%20System%20Design [2] http://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/43/, http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/chad-electoral-system [3] http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/chad-voting-statistics-overview [4] http://www.irinnews.org/report/58943/chad-opposition-denounce-presidential-poll [5] http://www.idea.int/uid/countryview.cfm?id=213 [6] http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/chad-electoral-legislation [7] http://www.refworld.org/docid/3cf4bc0219.html [8] http://www.irinnews.org/report/58566/chad-opposition-denounces-poll-as-masquerade-refuses-to-field-candidate [9] http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4967594.stm Question 2 Chad allows those over 18 years, with Chadian citizenship, and full possession of civil and political rights, to vote. Disqualifications included insanity, criminal conviction, undischarged bankrupts, contempt of court, prison sentence of at least two months for certain offences. ( Source: http://www.ipu.org/parline/reports/2061_B.htm ) Conclusion: Given that Chad has numerous reasons like incarceration for disqualification from suffrage, but not restrictive on more arbirtrary, unalienable grounds like race, ethnicity, or gender, Chad is rated 2 accordingly. ISSUE: The '3 points'rating 'universal suffrage'is misleading. I don't believe any country exists with universal suffrage in the full extent so it would perhaps skew the data of the project since those points are unattainable. Question 3 Incumbent President Deby and his party Mouvement partriotique de salut (MPS) have been in power since 2001 with 63.17 % of the votes, through to 2006 with 64.67% of the votes. In the 2002 National Assembly elections they won the majority of the seats (113/155 or 72.90%) [1] . Though Chad has an opposition (notably not participating in the 2006 elections), they are severly disadvantaged. They must finance itself independently and privately [2] . And with censorship and bias of media [3] and threats of political violence, they have little avenue for promotion or safe platform to campaign [4] . Conclusion: Given Amnesty reports of political detentions and violence on opposition candidates, the 2006 boycott by opposition parties in protest of the unfair and unfree elections, and the bias and restriction against opposition parties regarding campaign funding that creates an uneven playing field, Chad is rated 2 accordingly. [1] http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/chad-election-archive [2] http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/chad-political-parties-party-membership-and-party-founders [3] http://www.pressreference.com/Be-Co/Chad.html [4] http://www.refworld.org/docid/3cf4bc0219.html Question 4 One form of power is the ability to politically participate or be elected. Chadians can run as candidates as long as they are 25 years+, have Chadian citizenship, resided in Chad for at least one year, and are able to read and write French or Arabic. Persons under guardianship or having acquired Chadian nationality in the last 10 years are ineligible [1] . Further, any citizen is free to join a party of choice, but no one may be forced to join a party, be professionally prejudiced as a result of a party membership or belong to more than one party at a time. Other opportunities include holding public office. Beyond being elected into the National Assembly there was little-to-no information (in English) available about how public officers are elected. Another political power opportunity is a referendum, which can provide checks on executive power. Though Chadians have legal provisions for mandatory and optional referendums at national level, it is ineffective since they have no legal provisions for citizens or agenda initiatives at national level and there is no quorum for a referendum to be valid and no legislation specifying requirements for referendum to be valid [2] . Conclusion: Technically Chad has provisions for political power. But given the issues with arbitrary political detention and violence (for instance see here ), Chad doesn't have proper political power because these features may impede, prohibit, deter, or coerce citizens to avoid authentic electoral expression (via voting etc.) or from pursuing freely, honest political actions, opinions, or decisions. Chad is rated 1 accordingly. ISSUES: No definition was included regarding the meaning and scope of 'political power'. Chadian political power wasn't easily conceived as any of the scale rating and seemed to fall in between 1 and 2. Given the absence of necessary information about the ability for Chadians to hold public office and manage public resource and that most avenues of general power exercise are ineffective, I rated Chad a 1. [1] http://www.ipu.org/parline/reports/2061_B.htm [2] http://www.idea.int/elections/dd/search.cfm# Question 5 T hough the 1996 multiparty Constitution 'officially guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press', in practice 'the government severely restricts press freedom' [1] . Freedom House rates Chad 74/100 for press freedom in 2002, only slightly improving in 2006 to 73/100 [2] . The Reporters without Borders annual 2002 report states free press isn't present, echoed in Amnesty International's 2002 annual report. Actions like 'criticizing the president or other government officials, reporting on the northern rebellion, or casting government officials in an unfavorable light are sufficient causes for landing journalists and parliamentarians-and occasionally even private citizens-in jail.' Further, 'considerable censorship exists in Chad -both self-censorship practiced by editors, journalists, and broadcasters, and active censorship by the government, anxious to preserve its position and to not risk losing control again of the country in a coup or riot situation.' [3] More here, here, and here . Conclusion: Despite technical provisions, it's overwhelmingly evident Chadian media is far from free and fair; Chad is rated 1 accordingly. [1] http://www.pressreference.com/Be-Co/Chad.html [2] https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/chad#.VVH_Iut63zQ [3] http://www.pressreference.com/Be-Co/Chad.html CIVIL LIBERTIES Question 1 Chad has a constitution with any amendment initiative comes from the President after consultation. No amendment may be made while emergency power is in effect or during the office of an acting President. It was adopted in 1996 and establishes the framework of the Chadian state/government, specifying the rights and freedoms of its citizens. Recent 2005 amendments have eliminated term limits for presidency [1] . Chad also has a legal system, and the judiciary, courts, and police act as extensions for the rule of law though there was little in the way of sources accessible to reveal the extent to which the rule of law is upheld. The World Bank's Governance Indicator did however show Chad ranking poorly in rule of law here [2] . Conclusion: Chad has numerous violations of fundamental human rights however the reasons for violation generally speaking, like defamation laws, meant that technically the rule of law was upheld. In this case the rule of law was a pretense for oppression and control. Chad is rated 2 accordingly. [1] http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/chad/government [2] http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/Chads-Oil-Miracle-or-Mirage.pdf Question 2 Though legalities like the constitution are supposed to be the framework upholding civil liberties and various freedoms, the reality is far removed. Amnesty International cite attacks on freedom of expression, association, and assembly. Their 2002 annual report states freedom of expression continues 'to be threatened and human rights defenders work in a climate of intimidation and danger.' [1] Freedom of expression was undermined as the legislative elections approached; 'Non-state radio stations would not be allowed to broadcast political programs or debates during the electoral campaign.' [2] 'Michaël Didama, acting editor of the newspaper Le Temps, received a six-month suspended sentence after being found guilty of defamation in January. He was also ordered to pay substantial damages. The complaint& was lodged by one of President Déby's nephews after Le Temps alleged that a number of attempted coups had been carried out by relatives of President Déby.' [3] In particular are issues around the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline. 'Protests against the recruitment policy of a French firm involved in an oil pipeline were arrested in Bam and& detained. They were released without charge or trial after three days.' Human rights defenders working outside the capital, N'Djaména, are particularly vulnerable to arbitrary arrest. More here . Conclusion: Whilst some rights are present (at least on paper), and exercised to a degree, robust rights are actively denied and those exercising them brutally dealt to. Chad is rated 1 accordingly. [1] http://www.pressreference.com/Be-Co/Chad.html [2] http://www.refworld.org/docid/3edb47e018.html [3] http://www.refworld.org/docid/3cf4bc0219.html Question 3 Chad has a judiciary consisting of a Supreme Court of sixteen members, the court of highest ordinary jurisdiction and also hears disputes about local elections, the Courts of Appeal, Tribunals and Magistrates' Courts. It has a Presiding Judge appointed by the President. There are eight President-appointed judges and seven Speaker-appointed judges. Court members are only removed from office if convicted of criminality. It was incredibly difficult to access information but one source detailed its inadequate and weak institutional capacity, is not always independent or impartial in civil matters, and is 'ineffective, underfunded, overburdened, and subject to executive interference' . 'Intimidation and violence against judicial branch members were also problems, and members of the judiciary sometimes received death threats or were demoted or removed from their positions for not acquiescing to pressure from officials.' (More here and here ) . Conclusion: Due to the weak state of the judiciary, corruption of process, and unhealthy executive influence, Chad was rated a 1 accordingly. Question 4 Chad has a few checks and balances in place, including an Ombudsman who is supposed to oversee reports of the Government administration and of public services or establishments. There are also oral and written questions parliamentarians may pose to a minister with reply mandatory within fifteen days. The parliament 'exercises this control by means of committees of inquiry and control, via hearings before the committees, as well as by missions to the relevant government sectors. Besides the questions, interpellations may also be addressed to the Government. However, only members of the Government intervene in the plenary.' ( Source: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/CtrlParlementaire/2061_F.htm ) Conclusion: While it is evident there are checks and balances, I wouldn't say they are effective and restrain power, evident in the (dys) function of institutions (see judiciary) and imbalance favourably disposed towards the executive. Chad is rated 2 accordingly. Question 5 There is little information on minority protection. The UN Refugee Agency s tates, whilst the government adopted a law in 2006 including the promotion of tolerance and respect for other cultures as one of the objectives of the educational system, discrimination against minorities in Chad continues [1] . Women remain largely discriminated against in Chad despite the constitution providing equal rights for all citizens. In practice there is a big inequality between men and women (who are underrepresented in government and decision-making positions) [2] . Societal discrimination also occurs routinely by members of virtually all ethnic groups, evident in patterns of buying and employment, 'of de facto self-segregation in urban neighborhoods, and in the paucity of interethnic marriages, especially across the north-south divide.' [3 ] Conclusion: Though there are legal provisions, discriminatory practice is evident on the basis of gender, ethnicity, and other minority demographics. Chad is rated 2 accordingly.

It's also perpetuated by the 'resource curse'; 'once the money is flowing, the unholy trinity of oil, power and corruption will make corrective action difficult' [1] . Transparency International data only went as far back as 2004, with Chad ranking very low between 2004-2006. In 2004 it tied with Myanmar with a CPI score of 1.7 (0 being the most highly corrupt), tying with Bangladesh in 2005 with the same score. In 2006 it slightly improved to 2.0. This score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts. The '2003/4 Public Institution Index -an influential ranking of the strength and integrity of laws and institutions and the presence of corruption published by the World Economic Forum -placed Chad at the bottom of the list of 21 countries surveyed.' [2] Further investigation revealed that, 'corruption, nepotism and the sheer murkiness of Chad's government have seen much of the cash either frittered away on non-existent projects or fattening public contracts run by the president's inner clan.' For example, 'members of the president's inner circle have formed ad hoc companies and charities to benefit from government contracts. An independent committee set up to monitor oil spending produced a report last year suggesting corruption was alive and well [3] . It also comes from 'civil servants who are not paid' [4] and even goes as far where 'in some cases, tax and customs authorities may facilitate evasion only to return later to pursue the infractions they facilitated.' [5] The 'corruption or abuse of office by the police and military are widespread'. [6] Other examples are arms embargoing [7], illegal animal trade [8] . An apt quote from Nadjikimo Benoudjita, the editor of Notre Temps (one of Chad's few opposition papers) says: 'Corruption isn't just a part of Chad: it is everything.'

"Sudan",1989,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","I have chosen the periods beginning at 1989 up until 2015 (present) as Omar al-Bahir carried out a coup in 1989 and installed a military government, where in 2003 he made himself president of Sudan. He is currently in power and thus his effective regime stems from 1989 till now. The evidence I considered when answering these questions comes from a variety of different sources and of varying degrees of insightfulness and information. One of the sources consulted (transparency.org, link will be appear below) states 'There is little data and research available on the country's state of governance and on corruption, particularly on its impact' . This is echoed throughout when conducting further research as there multiple sources suggesting very high levels of corruption but had very little specific evidence or in depth analysis for which to work with. However, one claim that is commonly made it that the regime of Sudan is one of most corrupt in the world and at all levels of society, this gives some perspective when making judgements where relevant data is unavailable. As stated before, there is little available data on the specific corruption within Sudan's regime so naturally some of the questions answered were 'educated guesses'. These guesses were made in light of other information that will be listed at the end but I am confident that they fall within the general consensus that Sudan is extremely corrupt, at least from an observer view. Furthermore, because of a lack of available and credible information, finding sources to directly answer some of the questions was difficult. But given the information I have that indicated that corruption is very prevalent in Sudan, most of the questions were not difficult but more independent judgement calls. The research results did not suggest answers that do not fit well the options. Being ranked as one of the most corrupt countries that are monitored, there was little doubt that a lot of the answers given tended to give very low scores and fitted into the more extreme options well. Below is a list of the sources and SOME of the evidence quoted (Some sources contained a great deal of general information whereas other had not so much) . It would be impractical here to give all of the evidence consulted in answering the questions, so extracts of good evidence have been given. Further and wider details about corruption in Sudan that were consulted can be found in the links.

"Fiji",2006,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Question 4 : I have said there were no elections held during this time because from when the military took power in 2006 until the recent democratic election in 2014, citizens of Fiji were not able to vote on their government. There were promises by the military of democrtic elections for 2009 but these were postponed until 2014. While it could be said this was just a period between elections (as we have in New Zealand e.g. 2011-2014), it is still considered to have not had elections as this was an 8 year period. For this infomation, I looked at 'Fiji's forst election in eight years: Why so many coups in paradise?', a CNN article, for some general information on the (then) upcoming vote and what Fiji's politics had been like since 2006. Question 5: I again had some technical difficulty answering this question as FIjian's did have the irght to vote, were promised they would still retain the righht to vote in the upcomong elections and did vote in the 2014 elections. However, I concluded they did not have sufferage as this is a democratic feature allowing citizens the right to vote and during the coup their were no elections for Fijian to vote on. Again I used CNN for this background information. Question 6: There was opposition to Bainimarama's regime. Many did not agree with his power believing it was illegal but the regime did not give them the ability to voice their opinions. Many opposers were alledgedly questioned and detained. The coup did allow opposition to run in elections, as there wer eno elections, thus there was little to no opporutnity for opposers to gain power. I looked at a report from the Nautilus Institution, 'Background to 2006 Fiji Military Coup', for this information. Question 7: A military coup, like this one in Fiji, does not allow citizens to participate in the country's politics. Opposers to the regime ofte faced consequences and there were elections thus no opportunity for others to gain political power. Question 8: Initially following the coup, media in FIji boycotted against the regime's attempt at censorship - key news programmes did not air and national nespapers were not published immeidately following the coup but were running agains soon after. While the media in Fiji was allowed and not completely governed by the military, media outlets who criticised the interim government found themselves facing reprecussions. Question 9: Only the military held power - there was no separtion of powers (the military had influence over the judiciary, legislature and executive), no transparency or acocuntability of the militaries actions or due process. This conclusioni s from the New Zealand Law Society's article 'Fiji sentences show continued erosion of rule of law'. Question 10: I had difficulties answering this as from hearing accounts of those livingin Fiji during this time, both locals and foreginers, many were content with their rights under the interim govenrment as their was minimal change to everyday life. However factual information Question 11: While there was suggestions of political influence over the judiciary, Freedom House in their 2009 report stated the judiciary was reletavely free and fair, the main issue being only the lack of resources, common in a developing country. Question 12: The executive had total control with no accountability to the legilsture or others though in the consitution there were checks in balance that were not met in the reality of the coup - this is a common feature of a military coup. Question 13: Relationships betwene Indo-Fijian and ethic Fijians are said to be one of the factors leading to the coup. Follwoing the taking of power by Bainimarama, an ethic Fijian, there were reports Indo-Fijians, often of the Hindu rleigion, were subjected to some discrimination by the majorty population. I look at Freedom House's report for information on this. Question 14: As there are conflicting views within Fiji and the world on the matter, if it difficult decide what ones to give more weight to and hard to not let my own opinions influence my conclusions. I have looked at both factual information and opinions of people living in Fiji during the coup and thin kthis allowed me to get a good understanding of the environment on both a personal and objective level. Question 15/16: Again this was difficult to answer but after looking at Transparency International and Freedom House, I came to the conclusion that there was some corruption within the interim government largely to do with bribery.",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,0,2,3,1,2,5,7
"Korea, Republic of",1988,1997,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Party opposition did exist, but the political climate suffer ed from oligarchic, personal/ presidential-driven tendencies. Parties were vehicles for the presidential candidate and their names were more for branding purposes than reflective of any ideology. As a prime example, the United Liberal Democrats were lead by Kim Jong-Pil, the reactionary/conservative candidate (Morriss 181) . C orruption in South Korea during this period was not systemic, but some held over from the authoritarian 'fifth republic' . Peter Morriss' article on the South Korean elections of 1996 was especially helpful here. The presidential rather than party/ideological nature of Korean politics here is of note, as is the oligarchic practical restriction of standing for election limited to those who had money or military connections. Morriss points out that, ironically, President Kim's anti-corruption reform platform was undercut by a scandal involving one of his closest aides having their own corrupt practises made public (184) . The inverse of this argument is that the very fact it came to light, rather than obscured by the president exercising executive power and deep pockets, is a sign of increasing transparency for South Korea during this time. Morriss does concede that many of the NKD's reforms were successful in furthering transparent democratic rule (183) . Corruption at this time consisted of cronyism rather than systemic bribe-taking or leaders accruing personal wealth. Freedom House's statistics on press freedom for South Korea are intriguing. Newspapers and news organisations were privately-owned, and there were no major censorship laws like those seen in China. Yet, there was much precedent for the suing of journalists for libel, that is, publishing works with falsehoods about public figures (including government leaders) in them. Journalists were in fact jailed during this time after accusations of libel, according to Freedom House. That the judiciary was (and is) independent meant this was not simply sneaky way for politicians to get rid of pesky news hounds on a whim -actual libellous statements needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, as with any other case. While this source is from 2002, there is little to indicate that press freedom was significantly lower or higher mid-way through the period studied. This does mean I relied upon an educated guess, taking into account analysis of earlier elections which did not directly state the level of press freedom at that time, and inferring from those. Many sources noted that press freedom was relatively stable until taking a turn for the more censored around 2008. This is not within my scope of study, but is helpful in ascertaining that press freedom was not far worse before 1997, otherwise there would presumably be much material on the matter, rather than academic silence. In 'South Korea's Miraculous democracy', Hahm Chaibong claims that South Korean politics at this time held on to a deeply-ingrained political culture of authoritarian strains, adding that: '...rampant corruption emerged from a political system and a public long accustomed to political expediency based on personalism and cronyism rather than agreed-upon procedures and the rule of law.' (130) I awarded only two points to the rule of law criterion for this reason, in conjunction with other research on the judiciary. This was the only academic source to produce such a concise and useful quote, but there were many others which supported the assertion. Indeed, it was borne out both in the occasional scandals and general culture of Korean politics at this time (i.e. giving death sentences to previous presidents for their 'corruption', albeit later pardoning them) . Most evidence for the judiciary question came from Freedom House 's report on it, published in 1998. Though n ot directly from the time-frame studied, most o f it speaks for a pre-1998 state of the courts . It elaborates upon the history of Korea's democracy while showing how the judiciary has, despite some minor ups and downs, been relatively free since the transition to Kim Young Sam's presidential office in 1992. Checks on the executive other than those provided by the judiciary were similar then as they are now. Impeachment by the legislature is possible, as was shown in 2004 when President Roh Moo Hyun was impeached, and this right had existed since the constitutional overhaul in 1987 (Chaibong 137) . It is likely that, though it was not used until 2004, this power could indeed have existed as a political reality were it attempted before 1997. More tangible checks have existed for as long as Korea's tentative democracy has, such as the opposition being prone to violence toward an executive they see as trying to curtail democracy. Sometimes this is borne out literally, as in the case of the opposition using sledgehammers to bash down a barricade by the government set up to stop them entering the chamber (see the Telegraph article) . Checks on executive abuse are not always from the creation of independent bodies like an Ombudsman (which are often unique to the Westminster system) ; sometimes they involve the permanent reduction of executive branch power. The wide mandate of intelligence agencies to arrest and interrogate suspected North Korea sympathisers was drastically reduced in 1994 as part of Kim Young Sam's reforms (Freedom House Report 1998) . Inevitably, due to the personal/presidential nature of South Korea's politics, and its unicameral legislature, it is prone to being, in the words of Geoffrey Palmer, an 'executive paradise' . The winner of an election often has essentially unbridled power for the next five years. I checked the '2' box for minority treatment, but this is in fact misleading, due to the poor phrasing of the question. South Korea does not mistreat any and all non-majority groups to the same minimal extent. In reality, the full 1998 Freedom House report details South Korea's unusual standards of only having intolerance for politically extreme views. Given that it is a virtually mono-ethnic society, there are few social issues on the treatment of ethnic minorities. The constitution guarantees freedom of religion, and this works in practise, with minority shamanistic pagan beliefs tolerated alongside the major religions of Christianity, Buddhism and Atheism. Freedom House documents the relative intolerance for individuals seen to be pro-North Korea, even if they do not publicly announce they are, leading to Red Scare-type denouncements that evoke Cold War-era McCarthyism in America. Communism is tied up with the North's tyranny in the minds of the South Korean public, and until Kim Dae Jung took office in 1998, ending the period that is my scope of study, any socialist policies were viewed with distaste. Sympathisers were a legal exception to freedom of political views under the National Security Act; hundreds of people each year were arrested for alleged North Korea sympathies and held as political prisoners during this period (Freedom House 1998) . If this question had instead asked whether any particular minority groups received certain treatment, alongside having all minority groups treated this way as an option, it would be more applicable to the situation here and, presumably, many similar countries.

"Kazakhstan",1999,2007,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Political Rights: There is a very low likelihood of government change in Kazakhstan due to the consolidated authoritarian rule that governs the country and the sheer size/dominance of the party. The number of political parties dropped from 19 to 8 in 2002, due to law changes that require a minimum of 50,000 signatures for political parties to reregister (Freedom House) . In 2006, the political parties, Asar, Civic and Agarian merged with the ruling party Otan to create the political party Nur Otan which gave them 90% of seats in Parliament. Constitution exemptions have allowed for the President Nursultan Nazarbayev to stay in power, with the usual maximum of two 5-year terms revoked in favour of the president to secure a 7-year term in 1999. One-point was awarded as Kazakhstan does hold regular, free elections but they are marred by the limited political party variation. This has be International agencies monitoring internation election processes, such as the OSCE which refused to monitor the 1999 election because it failed to meet basic standards. The leader of the Asar party is also the president's daughter, which indicates the likelihood that the Nur Otan rule will continue to endure into the future. Universal suffrage exists so 3-points were given. (Index Mundi) The only major contending political party in the 1999 elction was the Communist Party, but the size and dominance of the ruling Nur Otan party make it extremely unlikely for the opposition to gain power. Leaders of the opposition are often barred from election participation by government allegations and convictions of corruption such as Akezhan Kazegeldin in the 1999 election. Since 2001, the rise of the Republican People's Party of Kazakhstan (RNPK) has become the only serious source of opposition. However with a membership of 14,000, it is difficult to compete with 300,000 membership of the Nur Otan party. This is further undermined by the law requiring political parties to reregister with 50,000 signatures for the 2004 election. It is also a requirement that a politcal party have 300 representatives in all cities and regions. This quesiton was difficult to evaluate because constituionally all people have access to political power but in reality, the heavy weilding influence of Nazarbayev limits those in political power to his close associates and family. This is evident through the influence his daughter has as former leader of the Asar party which formed a (convinent) coalition with the presidents party, and her role as head of the state run news-agency Khabar. The political elite are also made up of heads of major businesses (Freedom House) which cites the role of wealthy in politcal power in Kazakhstan. Any media publication crictical and independent of the regime is quickly squashed by the government which is why Kazakhstan rated 0 for this part of the classification system. Most media outlets are controlled by Dariga Nazarbayev, the president's daughter and her husband, through privistation of media companies and all broadcast transmission facilities are government owned (Freedom House) . Law changes instigated by the regime ruler Presdient Nazarbayev, mean that publications that insult the honor of the president or disclose information regarding the president's investments/economic interests face criminal conviction. This has rendered independent media void and unable to provide an open, fair platform for political discussion and critique. Civil Liberties Abitary power is with the state, with the President having over-ruling power in all political matters. His over-ruling decision power extends from constitutional reform to local level politcals making dissenting political change virtually impossible. This question was a bit of an educated guess but constitutionally, Kazakhstan citizens have access to basic human rights. Citizens have freedom of religion. We can assume the citizens have little access to Freeedom of Speech as publication of dissenting opinion of the President faces criminal conviction, which by extension means there is no room for critique of the regime. The judicary system is heavily influenced by the regime. The President has the over-ruling power on the judicary system and regular amendments to the constitution to suit the political agenda of the regime have undermined the judicary system. The President decides whom will become judges most levels of the judicary system from the Supreme court to the locacl-level judges. Judges frequently engage in bribery. There are no independent enquiries Minority groups have equal legal and statutory rights but ethnic representation is very limited 3-points were given. The Assembly of Peoples of Kazakhstan does not give fair and equal representation as the President is the chairman and encourages members of the assembly to not engage in political matters. National cultural centres are also required to be registered with the Ministry of Justice, further restricting minority group's influence in politics. Corruption 'Corruption is pervasive from the head of government to low-level government workers'. - Corruption is heavily concentrated at the head of the government with the President heavily mis-using his position of power to remain in power, through constant legislation change. Misuse of public resources by top officials is the biggest form of corruption, which is clear in the case of the Kazakhgate scandal in 2003 which investigated allegations that U.S official James Giffen was sending 60 million to overshore accounts believed to belong to Nazarbayev. As aforementioned, constitutional amendements instigated and implement by the President himself provide special exemptions for the President (e.g to continue his Presidential term indefinitely) and also restricted dissenting opinion and the rise of any major political opposition. Frequent bribe taking by judges from government officials is conducted. Summary: Overall it was relatively straighty forward to classify Kazakhstan's governing regime (1999-2007) against this classification system as typical of a long-standing authoritarian regime, there were high instances of corruption and legislation/constituitional changes implemented to severly limit the likelihood of a change of government. Most of my research was taken from Freedom House due to the extensive information available and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace also provided background information on the regime.

"Lesotho",1991,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","I chose to focus on the years of 1991 to 2014 for a number of reasons. First of all it seemed a good range of years which encompassed the year I was assigned (2012) - significant changes in the political atmosphere of Lesotho occured during this period with serious ramifications for the nation's political identity. Democratic elections in Lesotho occur every 5 years with three major political parties occupying the majority of the nations votes. the nation itself is a constituional monarchy, however the King's power is largely ceremonial as he possesses no executive authority and is proscribed from participating in political initiatives. Universal suffrage is in place in Lesotho with anyone over the age of 18 permitted to vote and women gaining the ability to vote in 1965. Access to political power is largely accesible by all, however in terms of the monarchy, which as previously mentioned is almost entirely ceremonial: there is a hereditary neccesity in order to become king/queen. In terms of conventional political power, this answer was an educated guess. There are numerous examples of evidence that suggest access to political power eg. the ability to run for election or petition the government is seriously combatted by government legislation including the Sedition Proclamation and the Internal Security (General) Act of 1984. However there is a general consensus amongst political commentators that Lesotho's restriction towards public-government interaction is loosening, with numerous attempts being made in recent years to insist that systems are in place to support democratic action eg. the demonstrations staged in 2011 by unions and political groups to protest a number of governance and economic issues. Lesotho's contemporary govt administration has been responsible for the nation's adoption of several human rights law. Freedoms of speech, press, religion, assembly and association are largely respected with a few cases in each category exemplified as detrimental to the nation's human rights growth. Press is largely independent in Lesotho withe criticism of the government routine, however state owned media does exist and generally reflects the opinions of the ruling party. Protests have occasionally been dispersed violently with several claims that Police shot at crowds during the 2011 demonstrations. The judicial system in Lesotho is nominally independent, although higher courts are susceptible to external interference. Prisons are in a state of decay and are seriously overcrowded. There is an ombudsman's office in place in an attempt to defend personal civil liberties, however the ability for this office to defend individuals is seriously impeached by it's inability to enforce effectively. The legislative branch of Lesotho's government is made up of two groups: the National Assembly made up with 120 members and the Senate with 33 nominated members. The two systems theoretically work to balance each other's legislative action. The homogeneity of Lesotho's national identity is illustrated in the fact that a massive majority of the nation's population identify as 'Basotho' making rights for minority cultures obsolete. To this end there are no ethnic minorities represented in either chamber of Lesotho's government. Religion also proves to be of negligible importance in terms of disparity as an overwhelming majority of Lesotho's population attribute themselves as Roman Catholic (Christianity) . Corruption is a big issue in Lesotho: rife in all sectors of government and public services with cronyism prevalent in a state bidding procedures. Their has been an aggressive witchhunt against corruption by Lesotho's government yet according to the African Peer Review Mechanism, corruption remains the biggest issue that the country faces, behind AIDS.",3,3,3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,5,0,14,12,26
"Croatia",2000,2003,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","Since I know very little about Croatian political history I did a general Google search about Croatia, its History, the war of independence and the Racan Government to give myself a general idea of what happened around the year 2002.Based off of the research I decided so select 2000 as the Year to which to start my investigation on Croatia following the Croatian war of independence. It was a War over the independence of Croatia which divided the public causing over 20,000 casualties (BBC news, 2003) . It also saw an investigation by the ICTY into various war related crimes by top tier officials within Yugoslavia, convicting 8 elites (BBC news 2006) . Franjo Tudman, suspected of playing large roles in sketchy privatisation of Croatia movements was also under investigation but died from cancer in 1999. I also selected the year 2000 because it was the rebound year from a tough Croatian rescission in 1999. From 2000-2003 the government saw a huge restructuring under a new Racan government (under the leadership of Ivica Ra an) . This saw the dispersion of power and decision making spread among various institutions in a restructured parliamentary system (3) . It was generally considered a crucial turning point in a country that was in need of a serious rebuild. Previous leaders had make poor economical and selfish political decisions that had led the country on a downward spiral. In combination with this the people of Croatia were in conflict with each other, providing and environment of little stability. It was a three year bracket which developed the country of Croatia dramatically under the leadership of President Stjepan Mesi and Prime Minister Ivica Ra an. After 2003, the European commission issued a report on Croatia with it finding that described Croatia as being transformed from previous years into a country with a modern democratic government leading to a diverse and competent economy and with the ability to progress providing the reform stayed strong. I thought it would be interesting to focus on how the reform came about and how the Croatian government transformed its country in this three year gap. For question four. I scored it a maximum of three points, not because I felt that elections are fully transparent, but because the criteria of answer 3 was for filled by the Croatian government. The elections of both 2000 and 2003 appear to be free. On both occasions the elected party was not previously in government, so they appear to not have faced significant barriers to overcome the previous government. Also, the European Commission (2005) report following the 2003 elections described Croatia's election as democratic after taking on board recommended tactics suggested by the EU (4) . Currently Croats all Croats can vote at the age of 18, however if employed can vote at the age of 16 (5) . If the individual is seen as contributing to society he/she can vote earlier. Gender or ethnicity do not play a role but you need to be a citizen of Croatia. In 2005, the EU described Croatia's 2003 election as being held under Universal Suffrage (4) . EU immigrants to Croatia, under law, are expected to be treated the same when it comes to work, employment and creation law. MP are elected by everyone living in Croatia, although the votes and MP's elected are selected by Croats based on their ethnicity, with the Czech and Slovak Croats selecting Different Leaders. Using some educated guessing, based on Croatia's Corruption rating from Transparency international with a score of 38/100% in 2002 and a score 0f 48/100 now, the 59% corruption control rating would be at approximately 74%. This takes into account the ability for public to influence the private sector in a corrupt manor (6) . Along with this Croat elites must (not officially) have a certain level of wealth, and not anyone can be elected from each ethnicity. Croats have access to free Speech, and there are state owned and private media outlets. The two major private media outlets are owned by foreign investors. This is not to say that they are not corrupt, but more so that if corruption is involved, it has one more barrier to pass. All media is regulated by the government, which is a cause for concern as they can select propaganda which benefits them in elections and polls (7) . The Croatian Judicial system currently has three tiers. The Legislative branch is the highest authority that is directly elected by the citizens. They look at general and essential laws (laws around human rights and equality) with a majority rules system. Essential laws -seen as crucial and important -often need 2/3's of the elected participants votes in order to pass. Croatia holds no binding referendums, which leaves the public detached from political affairs. In the executive branch, President has the ability to appoint the prime minister of his choice, which usually goes the way of the party with the leading votes however the prime minister does have the right to the final say. Obviously it wouldn't be seen as a smart tactic by the public, but the president still has the potential and ability to act (8) . Settling disputes has been a long and demanding task throughout Croatian history and disputes often take money and time to settle (9) . Bibliography BBC News.

According to Wikipedia the last two presidential election have had a different outcome, meaning power changes freely. Also both the 2012 and 2008 election have been quite close, both parties came within 3% of each other. The first round of voting has many parties running, showing that there is a lot of competitive politics in action with little barriers to entry (Wikipedia) . People in Serbia are able to vote if they are over the age of 18. For question eight regarding the media I used this article: http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&mm=02&dd=19&nav_id=93238, which is commenting on report released by Reporters Without Borders. 'Authorities in Serbia had 'a very negative stance towards freedom and suppressed critical, free reporting and influenced editorial policies by pressuring the media, often financially via advertising' . According to Reporters Without Borders ranking system of free media Serbia dropped from rank 45 in 2006, to rank 80 in 2012 but made it back to rank 54 in 2014. Civil Rights: The government up holds the rule all law, but Freedom House comments about there being serious concerns about corruption and accountability lead me to give Serbia two points for this section. According to Freed House most freedoms are upheld in Serbia. I gave them 2 points for this though, as there are some restrictions on certain organisations forming. Also there has been some violent clashes with have lead some demonstrations being banned. According to the Transparency International Serbia's judicial independence index score is 2.4/7, there for I gave them 2 points. I did not have hard evidence for this, but assumed from the ratting given this would be where Serbia lies. Serbia has a Anticorruption Agency which monitors the government, but Freedom House states that misconduct is still wide spread and there is no effective track record as of yet. Transparency International has Serbia ranked 80/176 in the Corruption Perceptions Index. Ethnic minorities in Serbia are under-represented with in the Serbian Government according to Freedom House. Freedom House also notes that there is large amounts of discrimination against minority groups from majority groups in Serbian society. Corruption: According to Freedom house there is a large level of corruption within the Serbian government. There is no effective means to control corruption. Transparency International states that 52% of Serbians perceive that public power is used for private gain. Transparency International also states that 17% of Serbians have reported paying a bribe and most Serbians believe corruption has increase, with no effective means of stopping it. Political parties are seen as the most corrupt section in Serbian Society according to Transparency International Reference: Presidential election results: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Serbia#Past_elections http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_presidential_election,_2008 Voting Age: http://chartsbin.com/view/re6 Article: Censorship in Serbia is Easy to Prove: http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&mm=02&dd=19&nav_id=93238 Reporters Without Boarders: http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2011-2012,1043.html http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2009,1001.html http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2008,33.html http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2007,34.html http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2006,35.html http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php Transparency International: https://www.transparency.org/country#SRB https://www.transparency.org/country#SRB_PublicOpinion Freedom House: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/serbia#.VV05pvmqpBc",3,2,3,3,1,2,2,2,2,2,4,0,12,10,22
"Eritrea",1991,2013,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Eritrea defeated Ethiopian army in 1991, and got independence in 1993.Ever since then Eritrea have been ruled by one single party known as PFDJ (people's front for democracy and justice) it is the only legal party in Eritrea. Eritrea has no multi-party system, president Isaias Afwerki has been on power since Independence Day (Wikipedia) . According to human rights organisations such as amnesty international Eritrea never hold any executive or legislative election. Eritrean government made promises for election many times, for example Isaias Afwerki and his cronies set 2001 to for elections to take place, however they changed their stand, claiming that Ethiopia was still controlling the disputed area on the border. So the national election is officially postponed indefinitely (freedom house, 2005) . Eritrean government set up constitution commission in mid-1990s, after three years of extensive work which participated Eritreans throughout the country, the constitution was ratified in 1997. According to Wikipedia the ratified constitution called for 'conditional'political pluralism, it also restricted the president's terms in the office, it also opened the door for multi-party system politics, however the constitution never implemented up to date. However according to senior government officials and some the regime affiliated websites the local elections have continued, Yamane Gebremeskel the president's chief of stuff, said the electoral commission responsibility to set the day the local elections, he also stated that the national assembly mandated the electoral commission to set dates for local elections. As Eritrean citizen who keep close eye to what is happening in Eritrea, with the there is no such a thing called electoral commission, as Eritrea has no a national assembly today (Madot.com) . In 2001 senior government ministers and party officials wrote an open letter to the president accusing him of authoritarianism and called him to introduce reformation, as they have called for PFDJ to hand power to the people. The presidents responded accusing them for treason and run widespread defamation campaign against them. The president had army and security officials on his side, and arrested all the fifteen members of the group locally known as G15, as well some private journalists. In September 18 2001, is a day Eritrea's dream to become democratic country with proper functioning government institutions was buried, the newly born private press was banned for ever. Since that day Eritrea is a country with no elections, no free press, no independent judiciary, and only one party one man ruling by decree (freedom house, 2010) Political corruption and human rights abuse is a common phenomenon, with no constitution with no accountability to the rule of law, Eritrea today is known as North Korea of Africa. Some religious minorities such as Pentecostal, and Jehovah witness are prosecuted and they are officially banned, those who have been caught praying arbitrary arrested and languishing in notorious underground prisons. Amnesty International reported more than ten thousand prisoners of conscious are thought to be imprisoned throughout the country. Many detainees thought to have died including government officials and journalists (Amnesty international, 2011) . Finally I would like to post a video of President Isaias Afwerkis interview with CNN openly ruling out any possibility of holding election for many decades to come. http://www.madote.com/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAXKsZ8OsWo Freedom house, (2005) . https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2006/eritrea Freedom house Eritrea (2011 https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FOTP%202013%20Booklet%20Final%20Complete%20-%20Web.pdf Human rights watch, (2011) . http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-eritrea-2011",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0
"Indonesia",1988,1993,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","For questions 4, 5 and 6 I looked at the Suharto regime and how they controlled opposition parties to ensure that Suharto would continue to be elected for president. However question 6 is slightly odd. There were opposition parties but they weren't miniscule or never heard from. The parties were 4 Islamic and 5 non-Islamic and they were merged into two parties. The 4 Islamic parties became the PPP and the 5 non-Islamic became the PDI but they had no chance of being elected due to the government controlling who the leaders were in these parties while also establishing a system to remove people from their position if the government felt the need to. Question 7 I had to guess based off of what I have read so far. Due to the government controlling the leadership of opposition parties and being able to remove people from their positions, it seems that either the majority of people do not have access to political power and that power is concentrated within an elite few, or only the wealthy or certain families have access to political power. However because Suharto did not select an heir to his rule in case he was challenged, I assume that it is not the latter and that the former is true. The media under Suharto was controlled by the Ministry of Information and television licenses were only given out to Suharto family members, friends and wealthy conglomerates. News programs were all state-run although there were alternatives who produced their own news programs but stayed relatively tame. Questions 9, 10, 12 and 13 I looked at the Human Rights Watch World Reports for 1990, 1992 and 1993 which all show evidence that the rights of Indonesian citizens were being violated including freedoms of expression, association and assembly, right to life, not to be subjected to torture etc. (Human Rights Watch, 1990), (Human Rights Watch, 1992), (Human Rights Watch, 1993) For question 11 about the judiciary, I could not find any source about whether it was free and independent, so from the control Suharto had over everything else such as the media, other parties, ministries I think it is safe to assume he had control over the judiciary too. Questions 15 and 16 I looked at transparency international along with the BBC website which showed Suharto as being one of the most corrupt leaders in the world. They say Suharto accumulated between 15 and 25 billion dollars during his 31 year rule. He was accused of embezzling money from government donations to foundations under his control along with taking money from scholarship funds. Bibliography Cribb, R. (2010) .

"Guinea-Bissau",1999,2009,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","The resources I used as my reference were; Transparency International's country profile on Guinea-Bissau that can be found at http://www.transparency.org/country#GNB, The BBC's country profile at http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13443186 and the US' Central Intelligence Agency's profile on the country at https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pu.html. Guinea-Bissau is a relatively small country in Western Africa, as such it is situated in an area rich in natural resources and large enough population to provide for a good economy. However it is also characterised by unstable regimes, frequent government turnovers (post 1984) and multiple conflicts, armed or otherwise. The country's richness in natural resources has not been able to provide the country with an income with which to provide for the needs of it people. The potential that the country's resources has is taken away by bad governance (government official's abuse their power, taking away the profits for themselves), lack of investment, weak economic policies and a very low literacy rate with more than half the women in the country not being able to read and write.The country's financial stability is supplemented in large by foreign aid. As Transparency International's report places the country in 161st place out of 175 countries, corruption is widespread in Guinea-Bissau, abuse of power is common it suggests the country's political system is abused by those in power to benefit themselves. Political Stability has been one of the greater challenges of Guinea-Bissau, post-independence from Portugal in 1974 the country has been headed by a 'de facto' dictator that usurped power from an 'elected' leader and as such the country has not experienced a democratic transition of power in its history. Election results have been questioned by domestic and international bodies in more than one occasion. Coups that replace existing 'elected' governments are mostly overthrown by members of the military, with the military citing a multitude of reasons over the years including economic problems, abuse of political power among others as reason to overthrow the existing regime. The last elected president of Guinea-Bissau preceding the current president was assassinated, João Bernardo Vieira was a former military general that overthrew the democratically elected president Kumba Ialá having only served three years in office. Vieria was then himself taken out of the office by a group of renegade soldiers that carried out his assassination. This example of turbulence and pervasive political instability within the country has greatly affected Guinea-Bissau's problem with corruption and bad governance. In more recent times the country has been headed by either a presiding military council or a more internationally recognised elected president with the current president José Mário Vaz assuming office in June 2014 having won the most recent elections in the aftermath of the most recent military coup in 2012. In a recent estimate the World Bank estimated that more than half the people in Guinea-Bissau or a staggering 69% of the population is in poverty. (http://data.worldbank.org/country/guinea-bissau) . Poor and uneducated, the country's population has little in terms of political and social rights that they enjoy in practice.The country's other political institutions in the the legislative and the judiciary are undermined by the authority of the executive. Non-governmental institutions are also subject to state interference and are mostly prevented from discrediting the ruling party. Overall the profile provided by the institutions mentioned above paints a picture of an undemocratic regime within Guinea-Bissau.",2,3,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,5,0,8,6,14
"Timor-Leste",1990,2004,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","These are some of the evidence that I found quite interesting when researching on East Timor: On the 20th of May 2002 East Timor gained Independence from Indonesia. Getting to that position was very difficult for East Timor as there was so much opposition from the Indonesian militia who wanted nothing else but to keep tabs of them. Now that they have gotten past this obstacle, the new government is now trying to build up democratic institutions in a land plagued by neglecy and brutality. Although under new leadership East Timor has a long way to go in trying to eradicate corruption. One problem being faced by the country is the discrimination of minority groups. Ethnic Malay Muslims and ethnic Chinese face occasional harassment; while non Portuguese speakers claim to be at a disadvantage in competign for political and civil service posts as reported by Freedom House. Moreover women face problems such as domestic violence daily. The Judiciary doesnt help this situation as they keep a relatively poor record of these criminal practises. Their judiciary system also says alot about the corruption that goes on within it as civil law judiciary is weak and inexperienced. Courts are short on trained lawyers, prosecuters and translators. I found it difficult to answer question 12 as there is a limited amount of institutions out there that can hold the government accountable for whatever reason as most institutions are weak and unstable at times. All in all, the research I carried out suggests that East Timor is finding it difficult to move forward into a more transparent democracy as their past suggests otherwise.",3,3,2,0,3,1,2,1,1,0,4,0,11,5,16
"Singapore",1990,2010,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Not much corruption detected"",""Other""","Q4 - There are evidences show that legislature voting is not really fair in Singapore: In the Singapore's first presidential election in 1993, Lee Kuan Yew successor - Ong Teng Cheong - won against oppsition cadidates. The point was the the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC) rejected two potential opponents. Meanwhile, the defeated Workers' Party candidates were even faced a defamation suit from PAP. Additionally, in 1999 presidential election, opposition cadidates from Singapore Domocratic Party (SDP) was jailed for making speeches without permission.Generally, opposition candidates had to face alots lawsuits and bankrupting. Q5 - The Elections Department of Singapore has clearly noted the following suffrage for a voter are: being the Singapore Citizen and holding the Pink Identity Card; be at least 21 years-old; being a resident with residential constituency Address (Singapore's Elections Department website: http://www.eld.gov.sg/voters.html ) Q6- There is evidence that voting in Singapore is not completly fair and clean. Base on freedomhouse.org, the People's Action Party dominates the political process. In the electing process, it was reported that the opposition campaigns have been repressed by mass media banning, otherwise there were strict regulations (Retrieved from: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/singapore#.VV2iW_nvO01 ) . Moreover, Singapore's Constitution provided that a person that has been convicted of an offence is not eligible to stand for parliment for a considerably long time, which can be applied to poitical opponents and eliminate them from electing process (Retrieved from ' International Bar Association': http://www.ibanet.org/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleUid=77f9bba5-38bd-4a2a-8972-8680d7821d5b ) Q7- Not every person has access to the political power in Singapore, due to the pre-dominated PAP and its successors have always leading the process and even controed the civil society.Furthermore, Singapore is considered to have weak pluralist politics. ( Politics in Pacific Asia: An Introduction. Huang, Shiaoming. 2009. pg. 87) Q8 - In Singapore, Radio and television are both managed by government corperation. The press is also being regulated in various ways: through the government's licensing power or informal advice ( Milne, R., & Mauzy, D. K. (1990) . Singapore: The Legacy of Lee Kuan Yew. San Francisco : Westview Press) . Mass media was also limited: http://www.internations.org/singapore-expats/guide/16087-safety-security/limitations-of-civil-freedoms-in-singapore-16091 Q9- President: 'The President shall not be liable to any proceeding whatsoever in any court in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him in his official capacity'. (Singapore's Constitution, Chapter 1, Act 22K) Q10 - Civil rights such as freedom of speech or expression are broadly restricted in Singapore. (Retrieved from freedomhouse.org, and international.org ) Q11 - The judiciary was under the effection of PAP leaders, and to some extent was not judicial independent. Examples are the lawsuits and bankrupting mentioned above. (This part retrieved from freedomhouse.org: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/1999/singapore#.VV2l0PnvO00 ) . The same report in 2008 also confirm that the judiciary is not independent ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2008/singapore#.VV6jNPnvO00) q12 - once again, the power check and balance depends on the role of judiciary. But as mentioned, judiciary in Singapore is highly regulated by the ruling party. q13 - there are three major ethnics in Singapore: Chinese, Malaysian and Indian. There was not much conflict between these group. It was because at the point of establishment, Singapore has declared to be multiracial nation. Although, there were still some problem such as the majority or population is Chinese and caused some unequal treatment in employment. Even so, ethnic integration process in Singapore has seens positive results. (Leo Suryadinata.

"Saudi Arabia",2002,2011,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Saudi Arabia was a very easy country to find information from - it has been an important Middle Eastern ally of Europe and the United States for decades, so there is a wealth of reliable material to study in order to find answers to these questions. I am very confident in the answers I have given to these questions, as information regarding them is freely available online, including studies by Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, amongst others. Two questions that I had some difficulty with were Question 5 about universal suffrage and Question 15 about corruption. In terms of Question 5, I was unsure whether to go for option 0 or option 1; voting in Saudi Arabia is restricted to males over the age of 21, though there have been extremely conservative reforms to let women vote in some minor matters. I was unsure whether males over the age of 21 constituted a majority in Saudi Arabia, so I opted to go with option 1, as women are all banned from voting because of their gender In terms of Question 15, the data about corruption in Saudi Arabia seems to suggest that the corruption is largely limited to the elites of the government, i.e. the royal family. This was defended by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who was at the centre of the most notable corruption scandal in Saudi Arabia in 2007, when it was revealed that he had been paid $2 billion in bribes by the British defence contractor BAE Systems relating to the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Saudi Arabia and the UK. Thus, it seems that while the royal family are massively corrupt, the corruption ends there for the most part. Otherwise, Saudi Arabia was an easy country to find reliable information on in regards to the questions, and I am very confident in my answers to these questions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,0,1
"Russian Federation",2008,2012,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Is Russia a ''managed democracy'' (Kratsev and Holmes), a ''pseudo-democracy'' (Graeme Robertson), or just a kind of authoritarian regime among others ? Even if the common assumption shared by occidental countries nowadays is that Russia is definitely not a democracy, it is still difficult to range the country within the traditional classification of political regimes. That is why looking at specific features such as the importance of political rights, civil liberties and corruption is relevant in order to understand a bit more the current russian political system. The time period picked is 2008-2012, in order to analyze a moment of political change in Russia : four years when Putin was not supposed to hold power. In 2012, Putin became president for a new term, showing that russian constitution was actually weak in front of him. Indeed, as being president more than twice in a row was not legally possible, he had to find a trick to come back. The constitution is supposed to rule the functionning of the state, and the fact that Putin managed to get around it that easily says a lot about russian political system. It shows that what is supposed to be applied in theory is not always applied in practise. In fact, it is interesting to notice that the russian constiution is very similar to the french one, whereas it is obvious that both regimes are very different... Some questions above were difficult to answer because of that matter. In terms of political rights : In theory, elections are supposed to be free in Russia. Every adults can vote from 18 years old, for the candidate of his/her choice. This is what the constitution states, but in reality, corruption or pressure on voters can applied. Moreover, elections are not fair, they are ''rigged''. In term of political opposition, Putin has a control on it. An opposition is supposed to exist but Putin through the party ''United Russia'' has actually a grip on russian politics. Still theoretically, people can have an access to political power, but the road ahead would be long and full of obstacles. As an example, to be candidate in the presidential elections, 2millions of signatures are required, signatures that members of United Russia don't need to get. Putin is also the one who picks candidates of his party at every levels of the country (Putin's ''Power Vertical''), and he is the one who picked Medvedev to replace him as a president, while he was actually still ruling the state behind the scenes. That is why nothing has actually changed during that time, and that is why russian politics is usually defined as the ''Putin's system''. Finally, in terms of media, a censorship is applied by the government, but the internet is still a way to express freely in Russia. It is a very important point to notice, as generally, regimes considered to be non-democratic, control the internet. However, the questions on the database do not allowed to underline that specificity. In terms of Civil Liberties : The existence and the freedom of associations are part of civil liberties. In Russia, civil liberties tend to be repressed. If we take the example of a new legislation introduced in 2012, changing the legal status of NGO, it is obvious. Within the framework of that legislation, if an NGO gets its funds from another county, it has to be registered as a ''foreign agent'', which supposed that it is an ennemy of the power and that it has to be watched. However, partial rights exist in Russia. For instance, it would be wrong to say that freedom of speech is totally impossible. The protests of winter 2011-2011 happened and allowed people to express their opposition to Putin, even if this opposition did not manage to be a political force afterwards. It is also important to notice that the Krelim has a control on the judiciary, which is not free, not fair and not independent. Judges appeared to be often corrupted making verdicts unfair, and penalties are often disproportionated and sometimes do not even respect human rights. The case of the ''Pussy Riots'' is really relevant in order to understand the nature of justice in Russia. It is also interesting to focus on the existence of the russian ''prokuratura'', an institution dependent on the executive power, which controls the actions of the administration members and of the courts. It makes the political power able to participate and have an impact on the judicial procedure. Talking about the treatment of minority groups, russian consitution is supposed to protect them. However, russian society is quite xenopobic and in reality, the idea of ''equal treatment'' is not respected. As a matter of fact, between the time period covered, many caucasians have been persecuted by russian extremists, but the legal process did not reflect the facts. Corruption : This is a real problem in Russia. Corruption exists at every levels of the society. Between 2008 and 2012, Russia has gone from the 147 th country out of 180 to the 133, in t erm of corruption. This little improvement shown that the government tries to work on it, but it is a phenomenon deeply anchored in russian society. At a state level, the corruption is also noticeable if we look at the close relationship between the power and other groups of interests, or if we look at the way elections are engineered in Russia by ''Putin and his clique'' (Kratsev and Holmes) .",2,3,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,5,0,9,4,13

This was completely military fueled and no elections were held. Suffrage - In the absence of elections, suffrage was irrelevant. Opposition - NOT THROUGH ELECTION, two forces fighting against each other. RENAMO and FRELIMO fought hard against one another to hold power over different regions throughout the entire 16 year civil war. Both had power over the other, and their confilct was fueled by a belief that the other group was evil. Access to political power - Only military leaders had access to power. The tactics of this war were brutal and resulted in huge bloodshed for civilians. Media - The government was essentially two feuling military groups, and was not concerned with media. Freedom of media was not a concept as there was no working constitution. Rule of Law - No constitution, in 1989 a draft constitution by FRELIMO was the product of peace talks between sides, but was not enacted until 1990 but the brutal war was not over until 1992 Fundemental Human Rights - Mozambique was a place of massive bloodshed and fighting. There were child soliders. Global human rights activists were aware of the situation. RENAMO was known for its war crimes and crimes against humanity. All civil liberties - No working constitution! Only outside groups existed to help out groups. The post Portugal government was incredibly frail and divided and was not effective at governing so much as fighting. Types of corruption - Hard to tell! Because the two groups of the civil war were fundemental to the identity of the newly independent nation, there is little history to base this on, and the government was primarily inside dealings. Overall - sometimes hard to gather data because of the nature of the corrupt government. Most information was about the fued, not about the people who were subject to a corrupt government. I did the best with the information available, and really enjoyed learning about Mozambique, especially the peace talks which weren't covered here too much, a very cool history. I hope that the stability found in 1992 can be continued, even if some corruption continues to emerge.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0
"Belarus",1994,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","The first country that I'm doing my research on is Belarus since 1994 until the present day. Since the 20 th June 1994 Alexander Lukashenko rules the country. His style of governing is described by many scholars such as Steven M. Eke, Taras Kuzio or Vitali Silitski and NGOs like Amnesty International as authoritarian. The Bertelsmann Transformation Index 2003 ranked it as an Autocracy (Index, 2003) . Even the very first presidential elections were 'relatively free and fair' (Silitski, 2005) Lukashenko created his own political apparatus to keep power to himself rather than establishing more democratic institutions. Since then, like Vitali Silitski notes, Lukashenko's Belarus changed some major things within the state apparatus, which extend the personal power of the president and created a long-lasting non-democracy in East-Europe. He made Russian the official language, extended his first term of being a president up to seven years 'and replaced the unicameral Supreme Council with a much weaker bicameral legislature consisting of a 64-seat Council of the Republic and a 110-seat House of Representatives' (Silitski, 2005) . According to the Freedom House reports from 1998 until 2015 Lukashenko's regime is nothing but a restricting and brutal political system with a unchallengeable leader. They ranked Belarus as a not free state though out their reports (Freedom House Rating: 6.0 1998-&gt;2005 ; 6.5 2006-&gt;2015 (House, 2015) [-with 7 being the worst] ) . But just like Steven M. Eke and Taras Kuzio noted in their analysis of the Sultanism in Belarus -as what they call Lukashenkonism -we have to consider 'that the majority of the population either did not take this threat seriously or did not see anything necessarily bad in an authoritarian dictatorship' (Eke & Kuzio, 2000) and that there was support for Lukashenko's power extension since then. And although the constitution guarantees universal suffrage the elections processes are manipulated and rigged by the regime in favour to keep Lukashenko in the presidents seat or to change (with a referendum) certain aspects of the political apparatus to extend his personal power -like the Freedom House report says. The rule of law is not protected and the personal rule of Lukashenko and his regime established 'a growing personality cult in Belarus' (Eke & Kuzio, 2000) . There is no real independence of the judiciary (which is guaranteed through the constitution) . Not only that the regime gained control over the hole state administration and judiciary, they also managed to first of all weaken the opposition and then systematically get rid of it. Like Silistki wrote, opposition politicians simply died or got lost: 'First to go missing was Lukashenka's former minister of interior Yury Zacharanka' (Silitski, 2005) . Other sources like a BBC's article in 2012 show that the opposition basically has no chance and that politicians who are willing to challenge Lukashenko (direct or indirect) are jailed (BBC, 2012) . Other sources like a Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty article draw the same picture: there is no democratic institutionalization in Belarus and the opposition is taken out (and into jail) (Bigg & Hruzdzilovich) . Lukashenko's Populism is broadcasted through almost every media channel in Belarus. The regime is in control of the media and rules with an iron fist to end every kind of rising protest, organized threat or journalistic critique. Furthermore certain civil liberties such as Freedom of Assembly, Speech or Mobility are not guaranteed. The people of Belarus are not allowed to form informal Organisations and travelling is restricted. And even though the constitution ensures equal rights to everybody the reality in Belarus shows something different. According to the Minority Rights Group International and their report 2015 (Lattimer & Verbakel, 2015) Poles in Belarus have to fear some sort of Xenophobia. And GlobalGays.com notes that 'Homosexual sex was legalised in Belarus in 1994, however Gay rights in Belarus are still severely limited' (GlobalGayz.com, 2010) . All in all that shows a picture of an authoritarian regime or dictatorship with great power and force. It seems that Alexander Lukashenko does not have to be hold accountable for his action within the country, but he and his regime gets a lot of international negative criticism. Finally corruption within the Lukashenko regime is a big problem - although corruption is legally criminalized. Like the Freedom House reports show and the Business Anti-Corruption Portal notes: it is 'at all government levels in Belarus; industry, education, healthcare and construction are particularly vulnerable sectors' (Portal, 2014) .

"Comoros",1995,2005,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Comoros gained independence from France in 1975 and in that 20 year span has endured 20 coups. The constant change and shifts of power have made it difficult for any stability within the country. In 1995, following on the corrupt and oppressive regime by President Mohamed Said Djohar, Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim was elected in what is considered by international observers to have been free and fair. During Takis presidency he worked to root out corruption within the government, however he also removed all the women working for the government. Women were allowed to vote due to universal suffrage but they were mostly told how to vote by their husbands. Constant turmoil over independence and re-establishment with France between the three islands of Comoros led to inter island political conflict. In 1998 Taki died under suspicious circumstances and his replacement Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde, the interim President, postponed elections indefinitely. Not long after Col. Azali Assoumami led a successful military coup to overthrow Tadjidine. Following this Azali worked with the other islands of Comoros to initiate a power dynamic that would rotate leadership every 5 years between islands. In 2001 the draft agreement was signed and the following year a Presidential election was held. The election is reported to be marred by violence, with allegations of voter fraud as well as the boycott by two of the three candidates. It was later announced that Col. Azali Assourmani was the new president of unified Comoros. Individuals or coups that have risen to power have been come throughout Comoros independence. These coups often have powerful benefactors behind them such as Bob Denard, a mercenary, ruled with and behind Ahmed Abdullah who held power in the 70's and 80's. After a final coup that ended Abdullahs rule in 1979 he continued to lead coups followed by his sons later on. In Freedom Houses report Comoros stayed constant with civil liberties and political freedom in 1 -7 scale coming in at 3.5- 4 from 1995-2003. For political rights Comoros went from a 4 in 1995 to a 6 in 2002. In a Freedom House report on press it reported starting at a 35 in 1995 rising to a 45 in 2003 showing a decrease in freedom of speech, as the scale increases in a higher censored and monitored press. Transparency International reported Comoros as being in the lower half of most corrupt countries citing rule of law, press freedom voice and accountability and corruption being very prominent undressed issues.",2,3,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,10,5,15

The United States has since become one of Laos's most important trading partners. The influx of easy wealth into the country with no doubt has had a great impact on Laotian politics. 3. 2014 is almost now. 4. Elections are held in the country, but only for representatives in the National Assembly. But they are meaningless as candidates are fielded from local Party loyalists - active local members of Party and its Patriotic Front - and approved by local Party secretaries. Important positions such as President, Prime Minister, Central Committee and Politburo members are officially elected by National Assembly but de facto appointed by top personages upon consensus. 5. Laos does not grant voting right to those under 18, mentally ill, or incarcerated. And it prefers to keep the population away from mass mobilization and political participation. Interestingly, the court is given power to revoke one's right to vote and be elected by Article 36 of the Laotian Constitution. Since the court is not independent of the Communist Party, it can be used to disable political rivals. 6. Laos does not have an effective political opposition, if any at all. Some intellectuals provide gentle criticism of government policies but their number is tiny, their profiles are obscured, and their organization is non-existent. Furthermore, Laotian (political) culture is characterized by mildness and passiveness. 7. Most Laotians do not have access to political power. Those wielding it inherit from their predecessors or buy it with personal connections and wealth. Laos's ethnic makeup to a large degree is heterogeneous. Loyalty to the Party is of utmost importance and has helped many from ethnic minorities ascend the ladder of power. However, the Hmongs and Montagnards are implicitly barred from politics. These tribes are converted Christians and fought for imperial masters, and have been actively persecuted since nationalist / communist independence. 8. The rapid penetration of information technology and the lawless frontier characteristic of cyber space have been tipping the scale minorly in opposition's favor. However, computers have not been as effective as television in reaching rural areas beyond the cities, where most of Laos population live in material, and informational, poverty. Here, state media under firm government control and state propaganda dominate. 9. This regime is not constrained under the law. Legally and technically. Legally, it is the paramount leader of the country. Technically, the Party controls the National Assembly, charged with legislation, so laws are written as they suit the interests of the Party. Its leaders, both national and local, are officially subject to the rule of law. Hovvever, a regime built upon corrupt co-optation has not other choice but to give their supporters some leevvay in terrorizing ordinary citizens. 10. Laotian citizens and residents are accorded with all fundamental human rights by Laotian Constitution. However, the more important of these rights are subject to regulation by lower laws: freedoms of movement and settlement, of demonstration, association, and assembly. Article 42 of Laotian Constitution also allows for the 'violation' of a person's body, honor, and home without leave from the prosecutorial authority or the court. Article 41 requires complaints and petitions to be lodged to Party's organs according to Party's guidelines in order to be considered not illegal. In conclusion, freedoms are enshrined in constitution, but provisions are customized to be empty on their own. Instead of using amendment as done in the United States, constitutional conditions are stripped away and hidden in complicated legal decrees frequently changed without public consultation, aimed at increasing regime's flexibility to rule, disorientating the common folks and dissidents, discouraging their constitutional invocation, denying them shelter under the law. 11. Laotian People's Supreme Court is the highest judicial organ in the country, however, not the highest judicial authority. By proletarian dictatorship, the National Assembly is repository of all power in the state, including judicial power. It delegates this power to the Supreme Court by appointing judges from within the Party's rank. 12. In practice, Laotian government is answerable to the Party long before they are called to be held accountable to the public if grave circumstances arise. The Party by virtue of law and power answers to its own. There is no separation of power, no independent checks and balances. Power flows from the Party and is coordinated by the Party. Corruption investigation authority is available, but is staffed but the Central Committee of the Party, and answers to Party alone. After all, Party power comes from being the head of Human Resources, and knowledge impacting seat allotment is very much a Human Resources business. Parliamentary proceedings are open to public scrutiny. But meetings that truly matter, the Party Congresses in every five years, when all pillars of the country gather under one roof and decide the fate of the realm, are conducted behind closed doors. As are all other Party conferences. 13. Equal treatment to all ethnicities is recognized under the Constitution. But beyond that, there is no measure to protect or promote the welfare of any particular minority. And as mentioned, the government oppresses oppositional minorities such as the Hmongs and Montagnards. 14. I am very confident. Descriptions of Laos are not scarce in Vietnam given Vietnamese extensive commercial presence and ethnic contribution to Laos's population. I have also studied and lived alongside Laotian privileged kids. 15. & 16. It's just really bad. I don't want to spoil all surprised before we get to the Vietnam section.",0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,4,0,3,3,6

Additionally, the country is governed by sharia law, providing a religious basis for its enforcement, and the Islamic movement that was active in Kuwait over this period provided widespread conservative resistance to the government's agenda.

"Ethiopia",1999,2002,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Ethiopia in 1999 According to Steve (2010 ),In 1999, Ethiopia was really engaged in war with Eritrea and despite minor political problems, generally political parties and even people of Ethiopia had been sympathetic government. The war gave an opportunity for the prime minister ( Meles Zenawi ) to have consolidated power ( Ibd ) Political rights Political right in 1999 according to Human Rights Watch World Report 1999 Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) led Ethiopian government mad efforts to introduce political and economic reforms with the help of donor countries. Generally speaking, the constitution that drafted in 1994 allowed those ethnically based federal districts to have executive, legislative and judicial power. However, the EPRDF led federal government put obstacles over the judicial process by means of affiliated political parties who have greater influence in the regional admirations (Human Rights Watch World Report 1999 The government did not respect the basic human right of political dissents especially those who strongly criticized the government, many political figures were detained for many months without trail and exposed severe harassment ( Human Rights Watch World Report 1999 ) . For example All Amhara People Organization (AAPO) and the Council of Alternative Forces for Peace and Democracy in Ethiopia (CAFPD), are excluded and many people have been arrested without trail in the country side by militias who are loyal to the EPRDF affiliated parties. Judicial system According to Ethiopian constitution drafted in 1994 judiciary system is independent but in practice, judicial system of the country was under the influence of government. For example the practice of extrajudicial killings were commonly seen especially for those who sympathized with Oromo Liberation Front (OLF ) had been the subject of this systematic extrajudicial killings ( Amnesty International (1999 ) . According to US state Department, In February 1999, Soro district police committed atrocities over the two farmers who had been accused of cooperating with the opposition and for refusing paying taxes for the government and also one young man who attended funeral for the renowned and founder of All Amhara people Organization Dr. Asrat Woldeyes, became victim of extrajudicial killings. The report went to say that the Ethiopian government committed arrested twenty six Nuer who were the members of Gambela people's democratic Congress ( GPDC ) though twelve of them were set free soon. The cause of arrest for some activities directly associated with the student demonstration took place and Oromo people who were suspected of cooperating with OLF. In November 1999 a week long demonstration was held by the students of Sodo when two teachers had been arrested because they showed their resistance against the use of new language. In those demonstration ten people were killed and about hundred demonstrators got injured or wounded and also thousand faced arbitrary arrest (U.S department State 1999 ) Media In 1999, the government passed law that needed to review the 'application of private radio and TV licenses in order to prohibit/ restrict opposition parties'medias consumption US State Department 1999) . Even though Freedom of speech was relatively allowed but arrest for journalists were reported by US state department. For example, In June 1999 Dr Woldesemayat was the president of Ethiopian Teacher Association ( ETA) put behind bar for allegedly conducting terrorist activity and sentenced to fifteen years ( US State Department 1999 ) . The well renowned Samson Seyoum Kebede ex editor of GOH was arrested for allegation of inciting war and helping spread Islamic fundamentalism ( ibid ) In December 1999, Aberra Wegi, the deputy editor in chief Maebel has taken to prison because he was accused of demonising Tigray People's Liberation Front ( TPLF ) who mercilessly killed to the those captured soldiers of the ex-communist leader Mengustu Halimariam. And also Tesehalene Mengesha, deputy editor-in-chief of Zegabi, was accused of breaking press law arrested for six months and fined 2000 birr equivalent to US 250. In addition to in June Tewodros Kassa, editor-in-chief of Ethiopia, was arrested (Reporters without Borders) The international community condemned the violation of human rights against Eritreans who had been live for many years. A year later, after the war between Eritrea and Ethiopian, the Ethiopian government arrested and deported Eritreans. According to US State Department about one thousand and two hundred were rounded up from where they had lived and taken to prisons ( Dedesa, ) by the security. The ICRC reported that hundreds of Eritreans were held in the police stations. In June 1999 the Ethiopian government granted for the first time to the ICRC to visit where Eritreans were held. As US State Department report showed that Eritrean were allowed to go to any countries (except their country) if they got visa. However the government gain violated the right of those of who retuned back from Malawi ( US State Department 1999 ) . However, 6, 000 members of Jehovah Witness who had lived, did not face deportation as the Ethiopian government believed that they would face persecution if they went to Eritrea (US State Department. Freedom of movement Though Freedom of Movement Within the Country is enshrined in the country's constitution which is any citizen has the right to travel and emigrate but the government did not apply the constitution and All Amhara people organization who had been accused of treason in the 1998, had been denied the right of travel . and in similar way, the government denied the Norwegian human rights group who sought to supervise the election which was going to be held in 2000. In the early of April 1999, the Ethiopia government formulated policy that allowing Eritreans who had been in prisons ( Bilate and Dedesa ) to get visas from any country except Eritrea. About 90 prisoners had got chances of getting visas, most of whom got from (US State Department) Election In fact, there was no election held in 1999 but a year after ( 2000 ) parliamentary election was held. In that election relatively was generally described as fair election though there had been electoral fraud in the southern region (US State Department 2000) The Ethiopian Peoples'Revolutionary Front (EPRDF) had got high turnouts, opposition parties participated in the election but they did not do enough job due to lack of fund, were only competed for twenty percent of the federal seats while the EPRDF and its affiliated political parties won 518 seats out of 547 Meles was re-elected as in the parliamentary election 25 million people cast their votes and 35 opposition parties contested in the election ( US state department office ) . According to European Union observers, the election which was held in 2000 was free from violence though prime Meles zenawi accusing opposing groups for preaching 'ethnic hatred' in a similar way of what happened in Rwanda (1994 ( BBC 2000 ) Freedom of association (religion) The constitution respects the freedom of religion, the government, generally commendable on the freedom religion despite some local authorities did minor infringement on the right of religion (US state Department 1999) . Corruption According to Plummer ( 2012 ) corruption in Ethiopia is common especially in the government institutions and organizations for example corruption in telecommunication sector is pervasive. In 1999 though number of mobile phones was very limited but corruption was relatively high. I can not justify all my answers are right but I can justify all are reasonable. Pershanps in the 1999 Ethiuopia wa under new leadership which was the guerrilla fighters who overthrew the Dergi Regime. In fact It was at war with Eritrea and depoted and arrested thousands of Eritrea. I know both Tigray Liberation Front (TLF ) which domnated the ruling party EPRDF and Eritrean Liberation Front ( EPLF ) followed alomst the sytem though ideologically differeed. Therefore, EPRDF led government of ethiopia do not seem good at handling or treating minorities and and also seem intorelent when journalists come to critize. and the ruling party does not seem to leave power via eletions becasue even the 2000 eletion did not seem fair though some reports said it iwas fair.

Accessed from: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html Although there was scheduled to be an election in 2012 that never occurred, due to a coup staged by Mali solders who were mostly from the Mali's northern territory. Some of the soldiers had previously supported Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. The coup resulted in a temporary junta in the country. Following the junta, senior officials appointed a prime minister without a state election being held. Another leader then replaced him after only a couple of months. Again there was no election. This was partly because there was not sufficient time for one to be organised and held. (The Economist, 2012) Reference: Mali a l'aise; The coup in Mali. (2012, March 31) . The Economist, 402 (8778), 59 (US) The next election in Mali was in 2013. Freedom House said that: 'The constitution was suspended after a 2012 military coup, but it was eventually restored, leading to elections in 2013. In the second round of presidential elections, Keïta, a former prime minister known by his initials IBK, won about 40 percent of the vote and defeated Soumaïla Cissé, a former finance minister who received about 20 percent. Observers deemed the elections generally free and fair, and Cissé conceded shortly after the second round.' (Freedom House, 2014) The competition was reasonably fare in this election.

This is different from Reporters Without Boarders, which gives Mali a worse score in 2012 than in 2014 (Freedom House, 2012, 2014) . This could be because Reporters Without Boarders ranks countries comparatively and Freedom house gives countries a score out of 100. Accessed From: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2012/mali https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2014/mali Justification for question 26. According to the World Governance Indicators compiled by the Word Bank, Mali's government has declined since 2008 in its ability to uphold the law. It has become more corrupt in this regard. The decline became slightly steeper since 2011. In 2013 Mali had its lowest score since 1996 of 27/100. Mali's best score was in 2003 it was 52.2/100. This means that the government's ability to uphold the law has almost halved over 10 years (The World Bank, 2013) . Accessed from: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#countryReports Freedom House rights that: 'Mali's media were considered among the freest in Africa before the 2012 rebellion and coup' . (Freedom House 2013) In 2012: 'an unprecedented number of journalists were illegally detained and tortured by the military and Islamist militants' (Freedom House 2013) Accessed From: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/mali#.VV2RvNOqqko Justification for question 27. According to Freedom House, in 2013 Mali was 'Not Free' . 'Mali's political rights rating declined from 2 to 7, its civil liberties rating declined from 3 to 5, and its status declined from Free to Not Free due to a military coup that deposed the democratically elected president; the ensuing repression of the media, political actors, and freedom of movement in the south; and the occupation of the north by militants who harshly suppressed fundamental rights in areas under their control' . (Freedom House, 2013) This statement applies to Q27 and most other questions as well. Accessed from: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/mali#.VV2RvNOqqko In 2011 there scores were (0=worst, 7=best) : Accountability and public voice 4.9/7 Civil liberties 4.8/7 In 2011 'There have been few reports of government authorities detaining or imprisoning political activists or of extrajudicial execution or torture by state authorities since 2001.' (Freedom House 2013) During the coup political freedoms decreased dramatically before increasing again from 2013 (Freedom House 2013) . Accessed From: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/mali#.VV2W-NOqqkp Justification for question 28. I found this question harder to answer. A coup in Mali in 2012 changed the whole nature of the Judiciary. From one that had some level of corruption to one that was highly corrupt. I get the impression that the government that tried to restore law, order and political instability in 2013 also made changes to the Judiciary in an attempt to achieve these goals. However, according to the UN: 'Calling on the United Nations and the wider international community to help the Government of Mali strengthen its judicial system, the UN independent expert on human rights in the country expressed concern today at the difficulties facing Malian justice in the prosecution of serious crimes committed in during the violence that engulfed the north in 2012.' (UN, 2014) Accessed from: http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47252#.VV2ccdOqqko Also Freedom House paints a grim picture about what is taking place outside of the cort of law when it says: 'Malian army committed at least 26 extrajudicial executions, 11 forced disappearances, and more than 50 cases of torture or mistreatment during 2013.' (Freedom House,2015) Accessed from: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/mali#.VV2estOqqko Justification for question 29. Extremist army members from the north of Mali who staged a coup in 2012, would not have thought that the country had effective processes in order to hold the government regime accountable. They felt unsatisfied with the way the government was conducting its affairs. My understanding is that mistrust in the government had gradually been increasing particularly amongst those living in the north over a number of years prior to the coup. This suggests that the government was becoming more corrupt and less accountable in its practices. (Boas. M, Torheim. L, 2013) Reference: Boas. M, Torheim. L, (2013), Third World Quarterly, The Trouble in Mali-corruption, collusion, resistance, 34 (7), pp. 1279-1292. Justification for question 29. Freedom House sums up the governments treatment of ethnic minorities in the past five years: 'No ethnic group dominates the government or security forces. Long-standing tensions between the more populous nonpastoralist ethnic groups and the Moor and Tuareg pastoralist groups in the North have fueled instability over the decades, leading up to the rebellion of 2012. The rebellion was fueled by the involvement of Islamist extremists. Although the military government in the South and the Islamic militants in the North were ousted, Mali remains in a precarious position, where insecurity limits full political rights; political participation in the North in particular remains deeply constrained by continued insecurity, a significant population of internally displaced people, and lack of territorial control by the government.'

"Taiwan, Province of China",1987,1996,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","21. Lee Teng-hui was democratically elected the first Taiwanese President in 1988. Oppositional parties were still illegal then. 22. Every adult in Taiwan can vote, but you have to be born Taiwaneze and have to be in your home-place to vote. 23. After student demonstrations held in 1990, Lee agreed to hold proper elections . 24. All Taiwaneze citizens have the right to vote. 25. Lee Teng-hui liberalised the media, but still has some legal restrictions and political pressures 26. This is unfortunately just an educated guess. I couldn't find any relevant information for that specific time. 27. The regime has widespread human rights, with some minor influences on freedom of speech from the Kuomintang. 28. While the country is independant, China still has a large hold over Taiwan and the way they do things. 29. Taiwan is becoming more independant and moving more away from China, but the country is still split on whether or not it should be alligned with China. This hinders real developement and progress. 30. This is unfortunately just an educated guess. I couldn't find any relevant information for that specific time. 31. Unable to find a lot of data for the time, I am not 100% confident about the results found. I believe that I have found a sufficient amount of data, however. 32 + 33. Corruption wasn't common, and Lee Teng-hui's government sought to eradicate it. A tradition of the past was still prevelent at that time, which was buying votes. This was soon made illegal, but at the time of this study it was still there. I found many of the answers quite difficult to answer. While it was a turning point for Taiwan and democracy there, it is difficult to find creditable sources that go into detail. Much of the answers are taken from claims such as 'democracy brought on civil liberties such as human rights' etc, so one would need to assume that it encompasses all civil liberties. One thing that was mentioned a lot, was that you had to be a citizen and living in Taiwan to vote, some even saying that they need to be in their home town to vote. If it had happened sooner, there would be much more media coverage and things would be more up-to-date.",2,2,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,3,4,2,12,10,22
"Cote d'Ivoire",1993,1999,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","The Ivory Coast was once one of West Africa's most prosperous states, however the regime of President Henri Konan Bédié from 1993-1999 sowed the seeds of an ethnic and religious conflict that was to tear the country apart. [1] From 1993-1995 Bédié was not an elected president, he served as an interim president following the death of the nation's founder in 1993. Politcal rights under Bédié were fairly straightforward to classify according to our metric: The elections held in 1995 were not considered to be either free or fair due to the ban on opposition supporters and general harassment, [2] however universal suffrage was present. [3] Opposition parties did exist under Bédié, and they were large, but there was little opportunity for them to gain power. Indeed one of the major reasons for the down fall of the regime was Bédié attempt to make the main opposition leader ineligible to oppose him due to ethnicity. [4] As a result not many people had access to political power. Journalists were ill trained and underpaid, making them particularly susceptible to corruption. [5] The only media outlet capable of reaching the majority of the population were state-owned. [6] The civil liberties that people enjoyed under the regime were somewhat harder to classify. Bédié appeared to have the ability to change the constitution at will: he lengthened presidential terms to 7 years (supposed to come into force after the 2000 elections that were prevent by the 1999 coup), although it was a struggle to identify if this had been achieved through his own voice as president or his power over the legislature. [7] It was also difficult to access the level of human rights people had access to under Bédié, although it is evident women's rights were consistently violated. [8] The judiciary was neither free nor fair, judges were political appointees and were not limited in their terms. [9] No measure existed that could investigate misuses of power, all organs of state were controlled by the president. [10] Minority groups in the Ivory Coast were previously treated well, however Bédié's regime promoted Ivory nationalism (which ultimately lead to the regimes downfall) . Throughout the regime there was evidence of widespread corruption and misuse of state resources. [11] Under Bédié the Ivory Coast scored poorly across almost all of our metric.

"Comoros",2001,2014,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","I found it difficult to find specific information for many of the questions for Comoros. Some information also seemed contradictory, for example the extremely low freedom house ratings and the apparent existence of free and fair elections. Some questions were also difficult to answer due to the concurrent application of the French legal code and Sharia (Islamic) law, as this made it difficult to determine which is more commonly applied. Question 21 - Free and fair elections: Comoros scores poorly according to both Freedom House and Transparency International for electoral, and general political, freedoms. However, according to Freedom House Comorans have voted freely in several parliamentary and presidential elections since 1996. Political parties operate freely at both the federal and local level. Comoros also suffers from high levels of corruption and has a history of coups. As such I answered, 'Voting is free but opposition parties face some significant barriers to gaining power via elections' Question 22 - Universal suffrage: I answered, 'The majority of people in this country are able to vote. However, there are minor restrictions because of things such as age or incarceration, etc.' According to the CIA World Factbook, everyone over the age of 18 has the right to vote in Comoros. I was unable to find any other specific information on voting ability or restrictions. Question 23 - Opposition: I answered, 'There is a significant and effective opposition with a high likelihood of it being able to gain power through election' as there are several opposition parties and the government has changed more than once in the last ten to fifteen years. The presidency rotating between the three islands also ensures there is governmental change, at least in theory. I also selected this answer as I couldn't find anything to suggest otherwise. Question 24 -Access to political power: I didn't feel that any of the available options were entirely accurate for Comoros as, from the information I found, while not everyone has equal access to political power, wealth or family connections is not the deciding factor. Restrictions on access to political power in Comoros include gender; due to the presence of Sharia law women are underrepresented at the political level and only one parliamentary member is female, and religion; non-Sunni Muslims are also reportedly subject to restrictions and detentions. This combined with universal suffrage for those over the age of 18 led me to select that 'many people have access to political power, with some exceptions' as my answer. Question 25 -Media: Self-censorship is reportedly widespread and though the constitution and laws provide for freedoms of speech and the press these are not always implemented; Freedom House lists several cases of journalists, in varying fields of work, being arrested over reporting related to the issue of corruption. Transparency International's Press Freedom Index, which measures the violations of press freedom in the world, ranks Comors 45 th out of 179 countries. Comoros also scores very poorly on Transparency International's measure of 'Voice & Accountability' which captures perceptions of the extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media. As such, I answered 'Independent media may exist, but there is heavy censorship, self-censorship or government intervention in editorial processes.' Question 26 -Rule of law: I answered, 'The leaders of the state are not subject to the rule of law.' In answering this question I considered both Transparency International and Freedom House. On a scale of -2.5 to 2.5, with higher values corresponding to better governance in terms of the rule of law, Transparency International gives Comoros a -1.06, placing it in the 14 th percentile. According to Freedom House the judicial system, which is based on both Sharia law and the French legal code, is subject to the influence of various elites, including the executive branch. Pre-trial detainments tend to be lengthy, and prison conditions are harsh with severe overcrowding and inadequate sanitation, medical care, and nutrition. Question 27 -Human rights: I answered, 'Partial rights exist, but there is still heavy suppression and monitoring.' Considerations in answering this question included the following information from Freedom House: Freedoms of assembly and association are typically upheld, though same-sex sexual activity is punishable by imprisonment and fines; with prison conditions including severe overcrowding and inadequate sanitation, medical care, and nutrition: the law also prohibits discrimination based on gender but this is not always practised due to the concurrent application of Sharia law, which limits gender equality: forced labour of Comoran children is not uncommon, despite a labour code criminalising the trafficking of children: and non-Sunni Muslims in Comoros are reportedly subject to restrictions, detentions and harassment, while conversion from Islam and non-Muslim preaching is illegal. As previously mentioned, Comoros also scores very poorly on Transparency International's measure of 'Voice & Accountability' which captures perceptions of the extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media. Question 28 -Judiciary: As I mentioned in my justification of my answer to question 26, Comoros'judicial system is subject to the influence of various elites, including the executive branch. As such I answered, 'The judiciary is clearly not independent or free.' Transparency International does not have anything on judicial freedom in Comoros. Question 29 -Measures for regime accountability: According to Freedom House Comoros has a constitutional court that provides a check on electoral corruption, as well as other constitutional violations by the government. However, I'm not sure as to the effectiveness of the court as corruption is high in Comoros, and the fact that the constitutional court upheld the election of President Dhoinine in 2010 despite irregularities being reported on one of the islands. However, President Ikililou Dhoinine introduced the National Commission for the Prevention and Fight Against Corruption, which has had a positive effect on Comoros'ranking on Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index. There is also and Anti-Corruption Commission and a Supervisory Body for the Approval of Government Procurement (information found on Global Voices online) . This led to me answering 'Somewhere in between...' as there are some checks on power put in place by the current governemnt, and they appear to be becoming more effective. Questions 30 -Minority Groups: I answered 'There are only minimal rights for minority groups, and these may be often violated by the government.' According to Freedom House 98 percent of the populations are Sunni Muslim and non-Sunni Muslims are subject to restrictions, detentions, and harassment. Same-sex sexual activity is also punishable by imprisonment and fines. Question 31 -Confidence in answers: I selected a three in regards to my confidence in my answers to the above questions as the countries ratings on Freedom House and Transparency International are very poor, but the written information I accessed did not always correlate with this, as such I was unsure of how to answer some of the questions. Question 32 -Corruption: Comoros has a Corruption Perception Index score of 2.8 out of 10, which is 24% worse than the average. The World Bank's Control of Corruption Indicator ranks Comoros in the 25.6 th percentile. While it is currently ranked 127 th out of 177 countries, Comoros has gained six places compared to its 2012 ranking. According to 'Global Voices Online'this may be due to the installation of the National Commission for the Prevention and Fight Against Corruption by President Ikililou Dhoinine, which has laid the foundation for the fight against corruption in Comoros. Dhoinine has also signed an application decree establishing the Regulatory Authority for Public Procurement, committing to growing transparency in public affairs. These measures alongside checks such as the Anti-Corruption Commission should continue to see a decrease in corruption in Comoros. As corruption is being actively combatted I answered 'Corruption is common, but concentrated in only some levels of the state.' Question 33 -Forms of corruption: I didn't feel that any of the available options were quite right for describing corruption in Comoros as corruption is pervasive throughout the government, judiciary, and civil service, as well as among the police and security forces. However, I answered 'Misuse of public resources by top officials' as, according to Freedom House, in 2011, the opposition party -the CRC or Convention for the Renewal of the Comoros -led by former president Azali Assoumani, filed a complaint in a Moroni court against former president Ahmed Abdallah Sambi for alleged misuse of public funds while in office. A major cabinet reshuffle in July 2013 was also widely seen as a purge of politicians loyal to Sambi.",2,2,3,2,1,1,1,0,2,1,3,1,10,5,15
"Pakistan",1997,2002,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","I chose to focus around the period 1997 to 2002, because I wanted to include the election of Nawaz Sharif as Prime Minister of Pakistan, his subsequent overthrowing, and the military rule of Pervez Musharraf. My justifications for my ratings are as follows: 21. Elections in 1997 appear to be free and fair, Sharif defeated Benazir Bhutto due to a failing economy, and corruption within the government. The election was observed by international observers. http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2241_97.htm . In 2002, Musharraf relinquished power as Chief Executive (Prime Minister), but stayed on as President (until 2008) . Held elections, and closely followed them. Despite his assurances the elections were free and fair, many political parties alleged that the elections were rigged. However, none took further action. There were international observers present. I would not consider these elections transparent though. http://storyofpakistan.com/general-elections-2002/ . 22. 2002, minority communities were allowed to vote and contest seats for the first time. The age of voting was also lowered from 21 to 18. Before this, there were considerable restrictions to voting and participating in elections. Because these restrictions were in-place for the majority of the period I considered it to be only partial suffrage. http://storyofpakistan.com/general-elections-2002/ . 23. There is an effective opposition during democratic elections. Sharif's government was elected after being the opposition to Benazir Bhutto's pervious government. The 2002 election was close and resulted in a hung parliament. http://storyofpakistan.com/general-elections-2002/ . 24. Convicted people were barred from taking part in elections under the Representation of the People's Act. Several other politicians were unable to contest the elections, as they did not have a Bachelor's Degree, which was a mandatory qualification in the elections. Bachelor's Degree can reduce the chance for anyone to access political power. http://storyofpakistan.com/general-elections-2002/ . 25. Freedom House considers Pakistan's media in 2002 to be 'Partly Free', giving them a score of 57 out of 100 for 'Press Freedom'. Police shutdown newspaper offices under anti-blasphemy laws, which journalists claim were politically motivated charges. After the beginning of the War in Afghanistan, official expelled several European correspondents. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2002/pakistan#.VV3bBfmqqko . 26. Nawaz Sharif was allowed some lee-way when it came to manipulating the law, the military, and the governmental branches. With a strong majority in Parliament, Sharif was able to pass legislation with ease. He amended the constitution to take power away from the role of the president. He also attempted to interfere with the Pakistani Supreme Court. http://www.pakistanherald.com/newprofile.aspx?hofid=7 . However, with falling public opinion, and the attempt to manipulate the loyalty of the army, Chief of the Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf responded with a coup d'état. Sharif was removed from power and exiled, with Pervez taking power for himself. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/1999/pakistan#.VV3cI_mqqko . While Sharif was able to do as he pleased with a majority parliament. There was a point where the army felt like it had to act to ensure things did not get out of hand. Pakistani courts however did not indict Sharif for any of the charges brought against him, and he was allowed to leave the country. So I feel as if not everyone is subject to the rule of law. 27. Freedom House rates Pakistani civil liberties a solid five between 1997 and 2002. Meaning there are heavy restrictions on personal rights. As mentioned before, minorities only received the right to vote in 2002. https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Individual%20Country%20Ratings%20and%20Status%2C%201973-2015%20%28FINAL%29.xls . 28. In 1997, Nawaz Sharif caused problems for the judiciary. Sharif was able to openly criticise the Chief Justice Ali Shah without any immediate punishment. Sharif then removed two judges close to the Chief Justice Ali Shah. The Prime Minister's supporters then entered the Supreme Court disrupting a hearing against Sharif. The Court system was under the influence of the Prime Minister. http://www.pakistanherald.com/newprofile.aspx?hofid=7 . 29. Because Sharif's party dominated the 1997 election, and won a complete majority in the house there was no real power in the legislative branch to hold him accountable. Because he interfered with the court system early on in his reign, they had little power against him. It was not until the Coup d'état in 1999, that Sharif was finally held accountable. 30. There was unequal treatment of minority ethnic groups within Pakistan during the period. Pakistan's anti-blasphemy laws (against the Prophet Mohammad) were/are used to intimidate religious minorities. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/30/pakistan-tops-worst-list-for-religious-freedom/ . 31. Some of the sources I have used may not be supported by academic findings (Pakistan Herald, Story of Pakistan) . 32. Benazir Bhutto had been removed from office due to widespread corruption in and around her office. Sharif was also sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for corruption. It was reported that investigators were looking into 18 separate allegations of corruption by former Prime Minister Sharif. These however, may or may not have been false allegations, with a sham trial orchestrated by Musharraf. I will however consider corruption to be pervasive throughout the Sharif Government. So it is difficult to answer. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/845490.stm . 33. The case against Sharif centred around a civilian helicopter he had supposedly owned during the mid-1990s, and had not paid taxes on. In my opinion, this is classified as special privileges, and misuse of public resources? http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/845490.stm.",2,2,3,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,3,0,11,4,15
"Nepal",2004,2006,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","During the early part of the timeframe analysed in this exercise Nepal was still in a state of Civil war. Maoist rebels fought with the monarchy for great political control and the establishment of a People's Republic of Nepal. The conflict lasted 10 years and meant that democratic principles came under threat with the King seizing full control over Nepal in 2005. Corruption was also rife as the monarchy sought to stay in power by any means necessary. Peace accords in 2006 ended the civil war and saw in a paradigm shift to democracy in Nepal. Firstly, Nepal's elections were confined to the legislature with the executive being the King and royal family. These elections did mean that local representatives were elected and competition was rife and political parties did gain some control, but ultimate power always lay with the Monarch. From 2004 the Maoist insurgency had fallen into a stalemate with the large population centres held be government forces with the Maoist rebels holding much of the countryside. This prevented elections from taking place and forced the King to take absolute control in 2005. Nepal's monarchy was in complete control of the central government for the year of 2005 and was willing to reach a compromise in 2006 in order to ensure peace for the country. 2006 also saw the shift towards a more democratic and inclusive nation with the Maoists standing for political office. Secondly, during the insurgency journalists and wealthy individuals were targeted by the rebel groups, which decreased economic and press activity greatly. Freedom of the press could not be guaranteed by the state as journalists faced the very real prospect of assassination by Maoists. The monarchy also vetted press releases to further its own agenda. (Freedom House, 2005) . Press freedoms were greatly reduced over this period and this flowed onto individual freedom as travel became restricted and security checks on citizens became rampant. The security situation in Nepal during this period meant that civil liberties were greatly reduced to combat the severe insurgency throughout the country (Global Security, 2011) . Thirdly, access to political power was almost impossible for the average Nepalese Citizen. Connections to the royal family or owning large plots of land were the primary ways politicians held power over this period. The monarch relied heavily on a network of family members who advised him who could be trustworthy. Maoist regions saw persecution of those who supported the status quo and enforced tough restrictions on personal freedoms in areas under their control. The monarchy also purged citizens who it believed were Maoist sympathizers and used the police to prevent public gatherings of more than 10 people. Human Rights Watch has noted many abuses on both sides during the conflict, with a spike in human rights abuses by the monarchy in 2005 (Human Rights Watch, 2005) Finally, corruption during this period was at an all time high. Former members of the dissolved parliament sought to remain in positions of power through accepting bribes and using their personal influence to gain favour among the royal family. Nepal was ranked 90 out of 146 countries surveyed in Transparency International's 2004 Corruption Perceptions Index, which highlights the severity of the corruption. Police were known to accept cash bribes at low levels and even senior public bureaucrats were known to accept assistance from organised crime gangs as the civil war deepened. During these years the Monarchy lost legitimacy with its people as it failed to uphold anti-corruption policies put in place prior to the dissolving of parliament.

"Iraq",2009,2013,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","The turn into the second decade of the 21st century was one of pivotal importance for Iraq. The United States, which had played an occupying role since its invation to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, were leaving, and the fledgling democracy it had created would be left to fend on its own. But, despite successful elections, the Iraqi government seems to be struggling with the tenets of democracy, and corruption remains pervasive. Although they were held two months late, Parliamentary elections in March 2010 were deemed relatively free and fair, despite violence on election day (Freedom House, 2012) . They were governed by a 2009 election law that introduced an open-list, proportional representation voting system, with multimember districts and seats reserved for women, Christians and other religious minorities (Freedom House 2012) . The Electoral Commission conducted a partial recount after opposition complaints, but no evidence was found of significant fraud. However, the elections brought months of political deadlock because none of the rival blocs, political parties representing various factions of Iraq, could combine to form a majority. It took until December for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to be reappointed after he agreed to form a unity government that encompassed all of Iraq's major factions (Freedom House 2012) . During this deadlock, violence in Iraq skyrocketed to levels not seen since the early days of US occupation, with insurgents targeting national institutions and other factions. In 2011, the United States began withdrawing its troops, and within days, tension again rose between Sunni and Shiite groups -and also political parties. Freedom House said this saw acts take place like Sunni parties boycotting parliament and Prime Minister Maliki seeking an arrest warrant for his own Vice President. It is for these sectarian and security reasons that Freedom House does not deem Iraq an electoral democracy. Although the country conducts meaningful elections, political participation and decision-making remains seriously impaired by sectarian and insurgent violence. The Parliament is also incomplete, with the upper house still unformed and executive functions remaining vacant (Freedom House 2012) . Regarding fundamental rights, Freedom House says political parties representing a wide range of viewpoints operate without legal restrictions -except for Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, which is officially banned. Freedom of expression is enshrined in the constitution, however it is impeded by sectarian tension and fear of violent reprisals. The media is allowed to function without significant interference, although party ownership, security fears and threats of violence towards journalists create an environment of minor self-censorship (Freedom House 2012) . Freedom of religion and assembly is also guaranteed, however sectarian violence has threatened both of these. Arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, and inhumane treatment are all banned under the constitution, but there are few effective safeguards to prevent them from happening, and reports of it are commonplace (Freedom House 2012) . Transparency International rates Iraq as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, with corruption being endemic at every level and in every facet of the government. It says corruption risks have been exacerbated by the historical legacy of the Hussein regime, a lack of experience in the public sector, a weak capacity to absorb aid money, sectarian issues and a lack of political will for anti-corruption efforts (Pring 2015, p1) . Iraq's main anti-corruption body, the Commission of Integrity, has estimated that US$330 billion of public money is missing or unaccounted for (Pring 2015, p8) . While a number of anti-corruption initiatives have been introduced in the country, the legal framework is insufficient to tackle corruption, according to Transparency International. The Commission of Integrity is subject to interference from the government, and the Ombudsman's office is weak and under-funded (Pring 2015, p8) . The judiciary, like other institutions, while constitutionally independent, suffered from nepotism and clientelism (Pring 2015, p9) . In his article Iraq: The Masked Democracy? Aaron Edwards writes that despite strong election turnouts, Iraq is far from stable and that widespread sectarian violence, human rights abuses and endemic corruption leaves a question mark hanging over the country's political future (Edwards, 2013: p 12) . ===== Justifications: Q21,22,23,24: These answers are based off the 2010 election. Q21: Banning the Baathists is still a restriction, hence why it was marked down. Also, the security situation may have played a role in preventing people from voting. Q23: A significant and effective opposition exists to the point of political stagnation. Q26: Endemic corruption. Iraq was difficult to answer as none of the questions really took into account the effect a weak security situation and sectarian divides played in the country's instability and corruption. While there may be free and fair elections and rights enshrined in the constitution, in many cases these were over-ridden. Bibliography: Freedom House (2012) . Iraq: Freedom in the World 2012.

"Nicaragua",1999,2006,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Political Rights: Nicaragua between 1999 and 2006 was a country that generally protected political rights although certain restrictions did apply. Freedom House rated the country 'partial free'in 1999 and between 2002 and 2006 ( https://freedomhouse.org/reports#.VV5ycPmqqkp ) noting that 'Nicaraguans can change their government democratically' with the country having a voting age of 16, universal suffrage and a number of choices of parties. Although they do note that '[c] hanges in the political system in 1999 made it increasingly difficult for smaller parties to achieve electoral representation' . As a result I scored Nicaragua a 2 for question 21. In terms of access to political power, I had to make an educated guess. It seems like leaders of the largest parties generally retain their position for long periods so I would guess that, although people have access to and can run for local office fair easily, access to power at the highest level is maintained in a fairly oligarchical way, with a few families/clichés dominating national politics. Hence I scored the country a 2 for question 24. Another topic that informed my answer for question 24 (as well as 25) was press freedom. Although Nicaragua has a free press it is highly politicized with newspapers siding with particular parties. This led journalists to cite 'the lack of access to public information and the culture of secrecy that pervades the government' ( https://cpj.org/2003/03/attacks-on-the-press-2002-nicaragua.php ) as problems in 2002. They also voiced concerns that 'the government gives a disproportionate share of advertising to large media outlets that support its agenda at the expense of smaller organizations without government ties' ( https://cpj.org/2005/03/attacks-on-the-press-2004-nicaragua.php ) in 2004. For these reasons I scored Nicaragua a 2 for question 25. Civil Liberties: To answer these questions I mainly used Freedom House's 2004 and 2006 'Countries at the Crossroads'reports ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/nicaragua#.VV5yt_mqqko and https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2006/nicaragua#.VV6EYPmqqkp ) . These reports showed that while Nicaragua has all the trappings of a liberal democracy (constitution proclaiming rule of law, separation of powers, freedom of speech etc) in reality such institutions are generally quite flawed (although not completely for show) . I had difficultly answering question 26 as there was no option for people with means (not just those in power influencing the outcome of criminal and civil matters. The 2006 report states that although rule of law is guaranteed by the constitution, 'the belief that people without means bear the full brunt of the law while the well-to-do buy their way out of trouble is pervasive' . In the end I decided to rank Nicaragua a 1 as the pervasive nature of such breaches made me uncomfortable saying that 'The rule of law is generally upheld, but notable and significant breaches do occur.' Freedom of assembly and association are respected with the 2004 report stating: 'The constitution protects the rights of public assembly, demonstration, and mobilization. Organizers of public activities must obtain a permit, but this is regularly granted. In general the government has not used excessive force to maintain order during public events, including protests and strikes. Political parties are free to organize.' However it goes on to concluded woman's rights, which are upheld in theory, are not in practice. The report goes on: ' Deeply rooted cultural practices of male dominance (machismo) and the exclusion of women from significant public roles (marianismo) are rampant. Episodic efforts to redress generalized injustice, for example in pay, have met with limited success. Similarly, though, there are measures on the books that protect women from domestic violence and rape, these have been under-funded and not pursued with great vigor.' This made answering question 27 difficult. In the end I scored the country 2 although I would not describe the conditions above as a country where '[r] ights are generally upheld, but there is still minor suppression' I cannot see heavy state suppression, monitoring or surveillance so it seemed like the best fit. The reports are heavily critical of the judiciary and checks on power. They cite the ability for large parties to colonize the judiciary at all levels as key issues asserting in 2004 that 'pervasive culture of corruption [within the judiciary] has yet to be fully addressed' . In 2006 is stated that: 'The branches of state do not check one another as liberal-democratic governance requires. Since 2000, the dominant Sandinista and Liberal parties have used their control over the National Assembly to colonize and subordinate other branches and agencies of government, with the current exception of the executive. In 2005, these parties continued to control the elections council, judiciary, comptroller's office, attorney general's office, and ombudsman's office, politicizing each and vitiating the independence of and separation among the powers of government, thereby fostering corruption.' However the 2004 reports explained that former president Aleman had been convicted for fraud and embezzlement. Therefore I scored the country a 1 for question 29 as 'the regime sometimes investigates alleged breaches.' Both reports raise concerns surrounding rights and representation of ethnic minorities however they are not openly repressed hence I scored Nicaragua a 2 for question 30. Corruption: Both reports cite corruption as a major problem for Nicaragua between 1999 and 2006. The 2004 report states that 'state is still opaque to most Nicaraguans' and that although the 'media have shed light on some state corruption, but the public does not have genuine access to government information' . The 2006 report gives Nicaragua a slightly better score but adds that 'corruption allegations are never properly investigated and courts issue few convictions' . Instead it assert that authorities have pursued cases that took place under the former president Aleman. All the evidence points to corruption being endemic within the government and civil service and that dealing with corruption is an inherent part of doing business in Nicaragua with public officials taking bribes and the judiciary susceptible to economic persuasion.",2,3,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,4,1,12,7,19
"Mozambique",2003,2013,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Political rights the main source I used to answer these questions was the EUs Mozambique Election Follow-Up Mission Summary 2013. Here the EU delegates outlined that improvements had been made in how elections were carried out in the country, however there were still areas that needed attention. An example was the worry that preventing people with criminal convictions running for president could be unconstitutional. An issue that this raises is that the incumbent government could strive to convict opposition leaders in order to exclude them from the political arena. This is a worry in Mozambique as the opposition party RENAMO carries out extensive protests against election processes. It would be possible for the government to arrest protestors, convict them, and then exclude them from running. Civil liberties For this section I used sources such as the World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples (WDMIP), The Open Societies'report on Mozambique's judicial system, and Freedom House's review of free media. Here I found that some extensive defamation laws protecting the President and other political elites degraded the freedom of press, as journalists are exposed to possible prison sentences. Further to this WDMIP's analysis of the treatment of minorities in the country highlighted the divide between south and north as a significant block to equality. The south represents the political elite who have consolidated power, where the north represents the opposition party RENAMO. As recently as 2005 there have been violent protests between the two groups. However the judicial system in Mozambique appears to be effective in ensuring the rule of law and holding government to account when it rules that there have been breaches in the constitution. For this reason I scored Mozambique threes on the judicial questions. Corruption Based on transparency international report on corruption in Mozambique the country scores a 2.7 out of 10, with zero equaling completely corrupt. Corruption in the country for businesses takes the form of extensive bureaucratic involvement in small to medium enterprises, drawing resources away from performance increasing activities and towards compliance. An initiative to reduce this is the simplification of regulations, a step that the government hopes will reduce the possibility of corruption and return firms human capital towards growth, rather than navigating complex regulation. Further to this the report found that there is significant regulation surrounding financing of political campaigns, but that in practice little of it is ever implemented.",2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,4,1,10,13,23

"Philippines",2001,2010,"""Other""","Philippines was a difficult country to consider because there were very few credible sources, I had to depend on Freedom House! The previous president was ousted amongst corruption rumours and succeeded by Arroyo who had appeared to have been very popular at first, but she did have to resist a few coups from supporters of the previous president. She won by a margin in the 2004 elections, however there were questions regarding fraud. She was accused of corruption (accepting bribes) throughout her presidency. The voter turnout was relatively high and there is competition for other parties, though how successful they are is debatable because of the suggested fraud. The media was free in what they could report, however they were targeted and there were many assassinations, death threats and murders during this time. Some of which were said to have been state sponsored. The government always denied this and said they were committed to putting and end to the killings. Human rights is also granted, but not protected.",3,2,3,3,1,2,2,0,1,2,1,0,12,7,19
"Brazil",1997,2006,"""Other""","Corruption as merriam-webster states is definied as 'dishonest or illegal behavior especially by powerful people (such as government officials or police officers) '. In regard to the question above, as well as the definition of corruption given, I believe Brazil to be a relatively un-corrupted country in the time period of 1997-2006. I have come to this conclusion after researching the government processes as well as looking at instances of controversy in Brazil during the time period. I found it interesting as well as optimistic to see that the government election's in Brazil are relatively free and equal. By this I mean that opposition parties have a good chance of getting into parliament. This can be seen in the two terms Fernando Henrique Cardoso served (Brazilian Social Democracy Party) from 1994 till 2002, when he was replaced by opposition leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Workers Party) . This is very important for two reasons, firstly it illustrates a functioning democracy, secondly Lula (as he is known) was a political prisoner himself, which shows that regardless of wealth or position any citizen (with the right mind) can win an election. It is interesting to note however, that Lula's government and subsequent legislature is considered the most corrupt in the country's history. However all is not sunshine and rainbows in Brazil. Groups such as the 'landless', people from poor backgrounds with no legitimate home have undergone significant violence from the police force. The police murder rate in Brazil is monumentally high. For example 'figures released by the state secretariat of public security showed that the police killed 317 civilians in the first seven months of 1999'. This lead on to 1997 having one of the highest rates of police homicide rate. This is important in regard to how the judiciary deal with these murders and whether the police officers involved are treated the same in the eyes of the law. 'From 1971 until July 1999, only twenty-eight officers had been expelled or sanctioned with a loss of rank in São Paulo.' This is the same state where 317 civilians were killed in the first seven months of 1999. On this basis one can see that only two police at the very most are punished for their treatment of civilians, while the rest (which number in the hundreds) are let free with no repurcussions for their actions. It is believed this is due to the Police force being exclusively dealt with by the military police rather than the government itself. The prison and rehabilitation system in Brazil is also heavily defunct and seems to be heavily corrupt in the sense that they are managing the system dishonestly. I believe this due to the statistics on how many prisoners the Brazilian jail system can hold, and how many they actually hold in the system. Census results in 1999 showed that while Brazilian prisons had capacity for just over 74,000 inmates, they held more than 170,000. More than double their capacity. To deal with this influx of prisoners, the system crams prisoners into cells in police stations (unfit for longterm prisoners) and over-filled prisons which cannot be managed and inturn drive crime forward rather than backwards through proper rehabilitation. Inside the prisons themselves mass violence has been shown to exist, for example 'On June 2, after a disturbance at the Americana City Jail in São Paulo state, the special police made more than one hundred detainees strip and then run a gauntlet. Police in two parallel lines beat the semi-naked prisoners with whips, bats, iron bars, bottles, and other objects; afterwards, they poured vinegar and saltwater over the prisoners' open wounds. A week later, at the Fiftieth Police District, twelve police officers entered thelockup, forced detainees to strip to their underwear, and engaged in an abuse session that included severe beatings with bats and metal bars, and electric shocks. Police repeatedly beat detainee Nilson Saldanha on the head, injuring him so severely that he died ten days later.' Such beatings and torture are rampant in the media, however not much has been done to solve the problem of over-crowding of jails as well as abuse of the prisoners themselves. In conclusion i belive that while Brazil has a great track record for free and fair elections as well as relatively good human rights, they fall short (and hard) in regard to police violence and mismanagement of the rehabilitation system which predominantly involves the poorest of Brazils civilians (the Landless) . This is a big short-coming as without a police force the civilians of Brazil feel safe with, the security of personal human rights is severly pesimistic and leaves the civlians exposed.",3,3,3,3,3,2,1,1,3,2,4,2,15,9,24
"Syrian Arab Republic",2000,2010,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Syria is an Arab Muslim country located in the West of Asia. Syria is the home to diverse ethnic and religious groups such as Greeks, Truks, Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, and religious group that include, Muslim Sunni, Alawite, Christians, Druz religion, Mandeanism and Yezidi and the Sunni Arabs make the largest group of people in Syria. These differences overshadowed most of the political cases of Syria. The research meant to examine Syria in the year of 2000 as a case study. The year of 2000, was the point of change for the Syrian politics. In that year former president of Syria Hafiz Al Assad, current president Bashar' father has died and therefore, Bashar Al Assad has taken the position of his father and was elected as the new president for Syria. Fair and free election for Syria? considering the results of the elections it is hard to say that Syria enjoy a fair election. Yet could be free but not fair election. In 2000, president Bashar was elected as the president of Syria when he gain 99.7% of the total vote and being the only and one candidate on that election which is lack of legitimacy. While there are no other candidates to compete with Bashar and form options for people to choose the candidate that represents them. Universal suffrage? Suffrage is the right to vote in elections, and the universal suffrage is considered being the most important in suffrage, when all those who are counted as adults in a country will have the right to vote without any sex, race, religious distinctions. In Syria, partial suffrage is alowed, adults who are over 18 and are able to vote are those who use to vote. Voting is not compulsory. Effective opposition?! In Syria there is no effective opposition. Absolute power lies in the hands of the ruling party. However, there are small parties that does not make any changes or noticeable influence to the decision of the government. In the year of 2000, there was no opposition to government. The election in the year of 2000 was more likely to be a referendum that has followed Bashar's nomination for presidency to confirm the Parliament choice bringing Bashar as president to Syria. Opposition to government was not allowed. Based on The Europa World Year Book 2002, Bashar's uncle, Rifaat Al-Assad 'claimed that the assumed succession by Bashar was unconstitutional, and declared that he would challenge his nephew for the presidency. But the Syrian authorities reportdly issued a warrent for Rifaat's arrest should he attempt to enter the country from exile.' Therefore, this approve that there is no existence for opposition in Syria, and that it is strongly prohibited. Do people have effective access to political power? Not all Syrians have access to political power, when there are still many Syrians are far from being able to participate in politics. The meaning here is that there are many people who still live in borders which is not being politically reached or those who live in the rural. On the other hand, people may have access but it is not considered being an effective access due to the policies that does not give the people the rights for effective access to political power or even the restrictions that it poses over them. Media act as check and balance on power? In Syria and most of the Arab countries' governments exercise its power to impose censorship in all different type of the media, visual or printed ones and certainly if a state denies to give its people the basic right to access to political power it will not let the media to act as a check and balance of power and off course if there is no opposition for the government it is hard to find an effective media that check and balance the power. Does this regime uphold the rule of law? the regime of Bashar failed to uphold the rule of law. The way that Bashar used to treat his people by and not being accounted for, show that the rule of law is far from being upheld by Bashar's regime. The fact that there are many people were suffering from being excluded from politics and the minorities that were excluded and not being treated well question whether the rule of law was carried out or not. Access to fundamental human rights?! Partialy. Some of the fundamental human rights which criticise the government and its politics is not acceptable. For instance, the case of Bashar's uncle, when he criticised the legitimacy of Bashar's government and that Bashar should not be the president since there was no complete legitimate election and that he would compete Bashar to gain the power. The reaction of the Syrian authorities was pretty tough when an arrest warrent issued against him, this show how the Syrian government is considering such speeches and that it afraid of all what criticise the government. Free, independent and fair judiciary? The judiciary in Syria is not fully fair and independent, when it is also influenced by some of the political factors. Especially in a country such like Syria the country that are imposed to many issues that threat the Syrian survival. There are no effective process to keep the regime accountable for all its actions despite all the attempts that are carried out. This illustrated clearly, when we see all kinds of injustice going on but no any changes are to be made in regards to all the issues. Minorities in Syria still facing discrimination. Regarding this, Syria is a country with the diverse ethnic and religious group. Therefore, the apartheid easily to be found and difficult to be addressed. Some of the answers was predicted from other information due to the difficulty to find the exact information that answer them correctly. As well as that there were some question which were difficult to answer either not covered enough or were not specific.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,0,5,5,10
"Mexico",1988,1994,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","I chose the 1988-1994 period due to the substantial moves towards democratisation and public freedom that occurred after the 1994 election, and prior to 1994 was the PRI regime which held the same office for 71 years with little substantial change in the regime. I began by looking at the political history of the country and then considering both data evaluations and written evaluations about the categories above, comparing the ways the regime did and did not allow political rights and civil liberties, and also the ways in which the regime engaged in corruption. Mexico's system operates as a Presidential democratic state where the President is both head of state and government. During this period there were high levels of corruption by high level officials that allowed the regime to stay in place such dubious election counts, high levels of influence and bribery controls on the media. Political office is partly democratically elected, however the PRI Party holds much of the political power and the presiding authority rests with the President who serves a six year term, and also elects judicial and political bodies, suggesting many of these bodies are independent, furthermore, it does not allow for effective accountability. Whilst there is universal suffrage in ability to vote, there are still restrictions on those such as priests or religious factions that may run for office. Some questions such as the corruption and q.26 I found difficult to answer because the options supplies did not quite fit to my regime, it was too narrow a focus. On corruption there are occasions in whihc the regime had been accused of using charity money or public money to fund its regime. However, i did find my answers were very occasionally educated guesses where I could find no direct confirmation of freedoms experienced in reality.

"Taiwan, Province of China",1990,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","The time period that has been chosen for the study of the political regime in Taiwan is 1990 to 2014, in which the political regime was democratic. During this period, Taiwan had undergone democratic reform between 1980 and 1990, after the decline of threat from mainland China and popular democratic protests. Taiwan ended it martial law in 1987 and gradually restored democracy. In the period of 1990 to 2000, it was a period of transformation from authoritarianism to democracy, thus during this time there were still some characteristics of authoritarianism. Since 1990, Taiwan has had a semi- presidential system in which the president is the head of state and the commander in chief of the armed forces. Both the president and members of parliament are directly elected. However, the period from 1990 and 2014 was largely democratic and political situation during this period was stable; there was no interruption by extra-constitutional forces. There have been peaceful transfers of power from one government to the next. In the democratic regime, Taiwan has a separation of power. Taiwan has a separation of power, there are five branches of government; legislative, executive, judiciary, control, and examination. The legislative branch is directly elected through the mix member proportional system. The parliament has the proactive and reactive power which means that they can create bills and pass legislation as well as reviewing and cutting the budget when it is deemed necessary. The executive branch consists of the president, vice president, and cabinet members. In Taiwan, the executive branch holds most power in the government. The president can request the legislature to reconsider problematic or controversial bill and if the bill cannot be passed within 15 days then it would be invalid. The control branch of government is in charge of the public service and the investigation of corruption cases. The examination branch of government is in charge of the civil service and examination of civil servants. The multiple branches of government demonstrate the great degree of separation of power within the government. More importantly, the branches of government operate independently of the executive branch. This is important especially for the judiciary and the control because they are important in combating injustice and corruption. Taiwan has an effective separation of power under this regime. Elections between 1990 and 2014 have been free and fair, and voters have had political freedom and rights. According to Freedom House, throughout his period Taiwan was considered as 'free'. There is universal suffrage, all adults (20 years old and above) have the right to vote. Before 1990, there was a monopoly of power under the Kuomintang (KMT), who established the nationalist government in Taiwan in 1949. Since then, the party controlled the state assets, media, and companies. Prior to democratization, there were authoritative elections in which KMT used party assets for vote buying and created patronage and clientelism with companies and local political factions. After 1990, the ban on opposition parties was lifted and the political playing field became evener. The first legislative popular election occurred in 1991 after the removal of the old legislature that was elected in 1947. The first direct presidential popular election occurred in 1996 which brought Lee Teng-hui from the KMT to power. Despite democratization, the KMT remains the dominant party in Taiwan politics and when Taiwan, the KMT had a significant advantage as the incumbent government. However, there was the liberalization of the media which allowed for freedom of press, speech and expression. For example, some newspapers no longer support KMT, such as China Times and United Daily News. Political parties used the media for their political campaigns against the KMT party during election time, which led to the decline of KMT's popularity. However, KMT dominance did not end until 2000 when the first non-KMT president was elected, Chen Shui-bian from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was elected the president. The democratic regime in Taiwan between 1990 and 2014 has been effective as it was possible for a new opposition party to be elected into office. As Taiwan became more democratic, the problem of corruption has declined. The contestation of power between political parties has led to the decline in corruption. It is common for opposition parties to target corruption issues of the incumbent government. A tactic in which opposition parties use against the incumbent is the exposition of corruption consequently, the popularity of the incumbent declined. The reduction of corruption became important in winning elections. The form of corruption common in Taiwan is public officials taking bribes from the private sector, the government has been subjected to the influence of big businesses. The liberalization of media played an important role in exposing the citizens to the wrong doings of the government and its officials. It is an important mechanism which has helped prevent public officials from engaging in corruption. References: Chang, Pao-Min. 'Taiwan: The 1994 Elections.' Asian Affairs 22, no. 4 (1996) : 224-38.

"Suriname",2000,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Suriname Suriname is relatively small state in South America, with a population of only around 500,000. The country while small, is a thriving democratic state, though this was not always the case. The country was ruled by Jules Wijdenbosch until 1999 when midyear his rule began to crumble and the likely favourite to take over the country was ex-dictator Desi Bourterse. Bourterse though had a checked past. The Dutch courts had tried and convicted the ex-dictator of drug trafficking just a few years prior. It seemed the country was not ready to forgive Bourterse as instead elected former president Ronald Venetiaan (Freedom House, 2001) . Venetiaan stated that he would focus on improving corruption and economic development in the state, as Wijdenbosch had left state with a 20 percent unemployment rate and a troubled legacy due to Bourterse. Venetiaan held power for ten years in the state (Freedom House, 2001) . For this reason I will focus on the stable presidency of Venetiaan, that is, from 2000-2010. The Surinamese state houses an electoral democracy, that is, the president and vice-president are elected indirectly. Elections are held every five years in Suriname where the National Assembly of Suriname is elected into parliament. It is this group who then decides on the presidency. Fifty-one members of the National Assembly had been elected on May 25, 2000 (Caribbean Elections, 2015) . The elections seem to be free and fair as all members of the National Assembly are able to vote on who they believe to be fit for president. The population of Suriname is also able to vote by using their polling cards (separate to a national identity card) . Both forms of election were observed by the Organisation of American States (OAS) . The 2000 elections were only the fourth time OAS had observed Suriname. The OAS stated the elections were conducted in a 'peaceful [manner] and demonstrated a spirit of tolerance.' (Organization of American States, 2001) . Therefore there are competitive and transparent free and fair elections with a high chance of the governing arrangements changing as a result of them. Though it was noted by (Organization of American States, 2001) that polling cards had not reached all pollers in remote areas. The Constitution of Suriname has universal suffrage, where all Surinamese national adult (above the age of 18) are able to vote. All voters must register as it is compulsory in the state to vote, though this is not policed (Organization of American States, 2001) . As stated above, the country holds elections every five years. Though the political system appears weak due to the lack of change in political leadership as the elites of the 1970s are in fact still in power (Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, 2009) . However, it still can be said that there was effective opposition in the 2000 election as Bourterse, was expected to win the election, but Venetiaan promised the country a better economy. Venetiaan eventually won out. There have been other presidents in the state (Wijdenbosch), and a record 23 parties competed in the 2000 elections (Organization of American States, 2001) . It is clear the state holds elections with a significant and effective opposition and a high likelihood of being able to gain power through election. While the country is democratic it could be said that not all individuals of the state have access to political power. It is said that woman have had little power in the state. The National Assembly is made up of 51 members but only six of these members were woman before 2000. There is also less representation of indigenous peoples (the Maroons and Amerindians) where there was only 12 indigenous members out of 51. It is thought that indigenous people are less likely to participate in the political process as these people often live in the remote areas of the state. That is many people have access to political, with some exceptions, i.e. sometimes woman and indigenous people. (United States Department of State, 2011) . It is thought that news outlets in the state were linked and influenced by many political parties. Senior government officials also used intimidation techniques on news outlets which posted negative stories on the government. (United States Department of State, 2011) Freedom House (2001) though, asserts that state media generally offers pluralistic viewpoints and that state and commercial radio stations compete with one another. I would say that while there was some government influence on what is being reported on, this was not always the case as Reporters without Borders found Surinamese media to be in a 'good situation' from 2008, where before that it was not recorded (Kholsa, 2014) . Therefore, no state censorship, but a degree of self-censorship may exist, or there is substantial government influence on what is reported . Civil Liberties in the state in 1999 were not too great with the state scoring a 3.0 out of 7.0 in the index but when Venetiaan became the president the state moved up to a 2.0 and has held this position ever since (Knoema, 2015) . While the state provides Freedom of Assembly and Association the country has a weak civil society as it does not have enough capacity to pressure the government, so the government is not pushed to uphold the citizen's needs (Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, 2009) . Though it should be said that rights are generally upheld, but there is still minor suppression . It could be said that because many of the ex-political rulers are still in power it is hard for rule of law to be established. These ex-leaders still have a say over the country even after having passed their time as president (Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, 2009) . Therefore while the rule of law is generally upheld, there are notable and significant breaches . The country hosts an extremely weak judiciary which often experiences political influence on cases. As Freedom House (2002) states, it is also ineffective as there is a massive number of cases to be dealt with and not enough staff. While prisons suffer from overcrowding and institutions such as the police abuse their rights and mistreat prisoners regularly (Freedom House, 2002) . Corruption was found as well throughout both the previous and current government (United States Department of State, 2011 ) . Therefore while the judiciary sometimes operated independently, it susceptible to undue influence and corruption . Suriname does not have an independent Ombudsman though from as early as 2000 there had been calls for one to be established. It wasn't until 2011 (after Venetiaans presidency) that the government accepted the calls to establish one. Also, the government had a noticeable absence of appropriate checks and balances (Cardenas, 2014) . As a result it could be said that there are no checks and balances on power, but the regime may sometimes investigates alleged breaches . The country houses two groups of indigenous people, the Maroons and Amerindians. These groups are said to be discriminated against even at the state level. While Surinamese law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, Freedom House reports that indigenous individual's rights to lands are not upheld nor is their cultural integrity (Freedom House, 2001) . Their land is given away by the government to the mining industry without consultation. Due to these minority groups often living in remote areas they do not receive the same access to education and health as other Surinamese do (United States Department of State, 2011) . There are legal and statutory rights, but there is active social and procedural discrimination and inequality towards groups or minorities, such as over-representation in the criminal justice system and electoral systems which lock minority groups out of power. Transparency International (2015) ranks Suriname a 4.3 out of ten in 2004 in terms of corruption. While the country successfully overcame the military rule of Bourterse and the economic deprivation by Wijdenbosch, corruption was still found throughout the state. The criminal economy thrived through drug trafficking and gold smuggling while social inequalities divided the state (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2015) . The countries ex- president Bourterse was on trial for drug trafficking during the time of the 2000 election, showing that corruption was found at the very top of the state. Although in terms of answering the question I would say that corruption is common, but concentrated in only some levels of the state as it seemed that it was mostly the old government who was corrupt and Venetiaan's goal when becoming president was for the state to become less corrupt, which he had succeeded in. The Global Competitiveness Report shows that the amount of bribes or irregular payments made were drastically decreasing (Knoema, 2013), from which one can assume that bribe-taking by public officials (or others) was previously being condoned, Condoning illegal business dealings can be seen in the state due to the large amounts of drug trafficking found, and Misuse of public resources by top officials can also be seen when the government takes advantage of the indigenous people over land. Special privileges granted to politically-connected people can also be seen in Suriname as Freedom House (2006) states favouritism was common among the elites of the state. The above answers provide reasonable evidence for each on the questions on the Regime Classification exercise. Therefore I would rate my confidence in my answers at 4.3 as I thoroughly researched the Surinamese state not just focusing on using one website and didn't make educated guesses, instead I went looking for the answers. Though I would not rate my confidence as high as I did for the classification of Mexico as when researching Suriname it was a lot harder to find authoritative material or a wide a variety of sources.

Regarding the political rights of Yugoslavia in this period, free and fair elections were present in the 2000 elections as NGOs were present to observe the process. Other elections have been corrupted by Milosevic up until then. Restrictions are present in the electoral process but during the 2000 elections, 70% of the population participated electing Milosevic's political opponent as the new President. Unsure of other election prior to 2000 elections. Yugoslavia allowed people of or ethnicities to form political parties allowing people access to political power but of course they still need to be elected into parliament. There were movement censorship in the years Milosevic was in power and there is still a small presents of censorship but a rise in opposition and independent media outlets have increased since 1992. Therefore the Yugoslavia political rights score is moderate showing partial freedom (score:10/15) Rule of law is not always followed. There allowance of fundamental human rights to an extent with some restrictions as there is a presents of harassment and tension between different communities such as the different religious communities. The judiciary was not independent and opponents of Milosevic were removed from office. Holding the regime accountable would not happen until much later (ie towards the end of Milosevic rules and international intervention) . Many crimes committed by Milosevic indirectly were never solved and ties with organized crime were very present. Treatment of minorities by Milosevic regime was very harsh and many activists were imprisoned only being released when Milosevic lost power. Civil liberties score: 8/15 indicating another partial free score. Corruption in the state was very apparent during Milosevic's rule and the transitions after his rule began the rise of anti-corruption taskforces that target those loyal to Milosevic and that gained many benefits from being his 'cronies.' Theft of from the public sector, corruption in the arm forces and local police, economic crimes and assassinations to name a few were all allowed under Milosevic's regime and that is why the international community saw Yugoslavia under Milosevic as one of the most corrupt states in the world (at the time) .

"Dominican Republic",1994,2004,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Question twenty one The 1994 elections saw the Social Christian Reformist party aligned with the Christian Democratic political movement, the leader being Balaguer, against the Dominican Revolutionary Party aligned with the Socialist International, whose leader was Gomez, against the Dominican Liberation Party, whose leader was Bosch. In this election it was observed internationally that there were irregularities in the voter lists and the Dominican Revolutionary Party charged the Central Electoral Board and the Social Christian Reformist party with fraud. These charges were not accepted and determined that 200,000 citizens had been excluded. Balaguer was sworn in despite popular demand for new elections. However, two years later in the 1996 elections, the Dominican Revolutionary Party won in its first round and was defeated in its second round by Fernandez'Dominican Liberation Party after gaining support from the Christian Reformist Party. These elections were deemed free and fair, domestically and internationally. Question twenty two This country has universal suffrage, people over the age of eighteen can vote, married people of any age can vote. There are exclusions of members of armed forces or national police, who can not vote. Additionally discriminated minority groups, can not vote, such as the Dominican Haitians. Question twenty three There is an effective opposition, there are several oppositional parties as outlined in question 21, it is possible for these countries to be elected to govern and gain power through election. Question twenty four The Dominican Republic is a small country where family connections and friendships play a part in politics. This results in wealthy elite and people with connections, by blood, marriage or friendship, being in power. Question twenty five The majority of media in the Dominican Republic is mostly private. In the early 2000s Freedom House suggested that despite newspapers being independent, they could be subject to governmental pressure through the denial of advertising revenues and taxes. In Transparency International's press freedom index, the Dominican Republic currently ranks 95/179. Question twenty six The Dominican Republic currently ranks at 25% in regards to how the rule of law is followed; data for the years in question can be found on World Bank and suggests that there was a ranking of 34% in 1994 through to 2000 http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c64.pdf Question twenty seven Freedom House claims that the government generally respects freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and association as human rights. According to the Human Rights Commission, prisons are often overcrowded, unsanitary and inmates are often the subject of extreme violence. Police brutality and police corruption has been a big issue in the Dominican Republic for some time, often clouded with allegations to do with bribes around illegal drug trafficking. Question twenty eight The Dominican Republic's judiciary is and was corrupt. The judicial branch is known to be another branch of the governing party's power, rather than a separate institution. According to Freedom House, the courts do not offer services or recourse to those without wealth or power. Additionally, in most prisons nine out of ten inmates have not been convicted. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/1998/dominican-republic#.VV7TZkJ0ba4 Question twenty nine When it comes to checks and balances on power, it is claimed that the Executive controls over half of the government budget. Additional claims state that checks and balances only exist on paper and that the judicial branch, as discussed before, is not independent. This article by political scientist Edward Gonzalez-Acosta comments that because of this non-separation of powers, it fuels competition between parties even more to gain control over all branches and resources. http://www.alterinfos.org/spip.php?article2032 Question thirty The Dominican Republic does not uphold the right to equal treatment and due process when it comes to minority groups. Haitians who live in the Republic do not have this equal treatment, Dominican authorities have been changing policies on nationality to exclude Haitians from certain rights. One ruling meant that the Electoral Commission was ordered to remove Haitians who were Dominican citizens from the electoral roll. Dominicans of Haitian decent can not travel, marry, work, register children or to vote, not to mention general discrimination. This minority group does not enjoy the same civil liberties as the rest of the public. Question thirty three When it comes to question 33, bribe taking by public officials and condoning illegal business deals both can describe the Dominican Republic's condoning of illegal drug trafficking for bribes. Many of these questions were hard to answer given the scarcity of data relevant to the country and general time period.",2,1,3,1,2,1,2,0,1,0,4,0,9,4,13

Investigating the DPRK did not unearth any information that was not expected. The provided questions were all relevant in classifying the North Korean regime as it is a less complex situation as it is obvious that the oppression, corruption and societal problems are either officially sanctioned by the government, a result of government activity or an essential part to the ongoing function of the regime. Unlike the failed government in Afghanistan the North Korean regime is strong and power is highly centralised around a cult of personality leader. North Korea functions as a single-party state under a totalitarian family dictatorship. The Korean Workers Party (KWP), which was founded in 1926 and led by Kim Il-sung, is the only legally permitted party. Kim Jong-un currently serves as the 'first secretary' of the KWP. The North Korean parliament is elected to 5-year terms. All candidates are selected by the KWP and they run unopposed. There are no political rights available and citizens or state officials that attempt to exercise any political belief other than that which is officially sanctioned by the KWP will be incarcerated in Nazi style prison camps or executed. All domestic media outlets are run by the state. Televisions and radios are permanently fixed to state channels, and all publications are subject to strict supervision and censorship. Access to information is strictly controlled and it is widely understood that the general population in the DPRK have no knowledge on the realities of the outside world and their situation. This is a key instrument of control employed by the regime. North Korea does not have an independent judiciary. The UN General Assembly has recognized and condemned severe DPRK human rights violations, including torture, public executions, extrajudicial and arbitrary detention, and forced labor; the absence of due process and the rule of law; and death sentences for political offenses. Updated South Korean reports estimate that there are 80,000-120,000 political prisoners held in detention camps in the country. Corruption in North Korea is an integral part of the regime. The misuse of public resources is so endemic that it has developed into an independent economy in its own right. The use of public funds in the purchasing of luxuries for the purposes of rewarding service to the regime has become a key instrument in the maintenance of loyalty and the development of admiration towards the regime. There is no Universal Suffrage as there are no meaningful elections but there would be little point to elections as the Kim Dynasty is idolised like gods and I would suspect that due to the ignorance of the population if free elections were to occur nothing would realistically change. There is no access to fundamental human rights in the DPRK as the state systems actively oppress individuality and focus on wellbeing as a state. There is no freedom of movement, and forced internal resettlement is routine. Access to Pyongyang is tightly restricted; the availability of food, housing, and health care is somewhat better in the capital than in the rest of the country. Recently, this disparity has increased, with the capital featuring more luxuries for a growing middle class. North Korea is among the worst countries, if not the worst in the world in terms of the regimes oppression towards its citizens. I'm confident that all answer provided are correct and a true and fair representation of the North Korean regime.

"Liberia",1997,2003,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","I will go through and justify my answers to each question starting from question four in a bullet point format: 21 and 23) The 1997 election of Charles Taylor was declared free and transparent theoretically, but practically there were serious difficulties for the opposition in terms of gaining any power. The Liberian Civil War had just ended, and Taylor had emerged from the conflict with near war lord status outside of the city of Monrovia. The countryside was the main site of atrocities and war crimes committed by militias and Taylor's rebels during the war - rape and violent murder being the main weapon of choice against civilians. Taylor won 75% of the vote in the Presidential election, and a campaign slogan of 'he killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will still vote for him.' Practically, the thousands of people that voted for Taylor were terrified that he would start the war again if he lost the election. Therefore, the elections were conducted under an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. 25) The Press in Liberia were mostly free with enshrined rights under the constitution and international treaties. Libel cases continue to be a significant problem in Liberia, despite efforts by the government to restrict criminal libel cases against journalists. Often the freedom of information laws are available to the public but are not widely known. Freedom House lists the Press Freedom of Liberia as 'Partly Free' 26) During the rule of Charles Taylor between 1997 and 2003 there was no rule of law upon the President. He was able to wield complete violence against citizens or rebels to his regime. He tolerated official opposition, but ethnic groups and rebel groups continued to be oppressed and Taylor acted as a war lord in his role as President. He also shamelessly funded, supported, and planned war crimes with the RUF, the main militia in the neighbouring Sierra Leone civil war, to generate personal wealth from stolen blood diamonds. In 2012 Taylor was convicted for these crimes. The President commissioned his own paramilitary units, especially the ATU, and used these gangs to systematically carry out extra judicial killing and rape of opposition figures. Rape in particular was used as it was a demoralising and devastating method of control. 27) Under Taylor there was a ban on political rallies and public gatherings for fear that the unrest in the unfolding Second Civil War would spill into the captial. In 2002 Taylor restricted further civil liberties such as the right of peaceful assembly to combat real or pretended threats1 to the government and his power. 28) as a whole, there is an appropriate separation of powers in Liberia according to the constitution. During the Civil War there would have been fear and chaos in terms of implementing the the rule of law - however, judges and the supreme court can uphold constitutionality and strike down laws which they see as being against the constitution of liberia. However, despite the apparently effective judiciary, there is still a prevelence of corruption through bribery, as well as severe lack of efficiency. Details of trial by ordeal and mob killing are still recorded widely in Liberia, especially in the countryside. 29) the regime of Charles Taylor was organised chaos - there was absolutely no way of holding the President or high ranking government officials to account. Under Taylor, the Armed Froces of Liberia actively recruited child soliders to oppress and fight opposition, and campaigns of terror were carried out in the countryside including burning of civilians, rape and murder. Taylor also actively engaged in highly corrupt and calculated negotiations with RUF rebels in Sierra Leone, offering them assylum and arms in return for political control of diamond mines in the neighbouring state. 30) Ethnic Krahn and Mandingo minorities were targets of abuse by government forces, and as many as 18,000 people fled to neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire as refugees. 31) I am fairly confident in my information and assesment. However, the information is difficult as the regime of 1997-2003 was essentially one run through anarchy. The entire time Charles was President, there country was engaged in a brutal civil war that affected all areas of civilian and state life. It is difficult to be able to make assertions between government abuses of power and opposition abuses of power - where both sides were equally guilty of atrocities and corruption throughout the conflict.",2,3,2,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,4,1,9,3,12
"Nepal",2002,2008,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Nepal Start date : I've opted to study the Nepalese state from 2002 as it was in this year that its newly installed monarch King Gyanendra dismissed its fledgling democratic government, according to infoplease.com. In this way an unelected leader did away with (Nepalese society's) elected representatives, and so the first step toward authoritarianism was taken. In this same year Gyanendra then proceeded to attack the Maoist rebels fighting against the monarchy. Freedom House confirms these findings, and reports that its freedom ratings declined from there on, peaking in 2006. End date : since 2008 there has been an upturn as far as Nepalese democracy goes; then, according to Freedom House and the BBC, elections were held, and the monarchy was abolished. Moreover the fact, according to Freedom House, that subsequent years didn't see a sudden reversal of this development, supports my choice of 2008 as the end of a monarchic and dictatorial period: according to Freedom House, a coalition was formed in 2008 -this lends further credibility to the practice of Nepalese democracy insofar as it implies a representative governing bloc; 2009 saw a Prime Ministerial dismissal of the army chief overridden (this implies a healthy democratic diffusion of power among Nepal's leaders) ; 2013, despite seeing violence, nevertheless saw new elections which Freedom House described as 'generally free and fair.' Free and fair elections for executive and legislature : I have given zero points for this question, as dictatorial monarchism characterised Nepal throughout my chosen period of study; monarchism which saw no elections, and a form of government only insofar as King Gyanendra arbitrarily appointed and dismissed it; In 2003, a year after Gyanendra ascended to the throne, he refused to call new elections, and instead appointed a handpicked 'interim administration.'Freedom House further reports that this situation continued through a failed attempt in 2004 to reconstitute government. In 2005, 'free and fair elections'were still off the agenda, as, according to Freedom House, Gyanendra further worsened Nepal's undemocratic situation by dismissing his unelected government and personally taking executive control. Nepalese democracy only began to recover near the end of my chosen period; in 2006 the Maoists joined with the rejected politicians to protest and resist; thus forcing the King to restore parliament. The prospect of 'free and fair'elections returned, and, in spite of subsequent violence such elections took place in 2008, according to Freedom House. As to verification, bbc.co.uk's reportings on Nepal are consistent with Freedom House's chronology. Universal suffrage : according to cia.gov, suffrage is universal -though naturally this didn't apply during Nepal's democratic drought, as referenced above. Effective opposition and possibility to be elected to govern : I have chosen one point for this question because, as per information cited above, when Gyanendra ascended to the throne he divested existing politicians of their power, assuming it himself. Political opposition existed during the King's rule, most conspicuously in the case of the Maoists; however they had no chance to obtain power during the King's reign -the King devoted efforts to combatting them (Freedom House) . Furthermore, as alluded to above, the King did appoint an interim prime minister, but the choice was partisan, according to Freedom House -it was taken in spite of a 'consensus candidate' decided by the Nepal's disempowered parties. And thus, political opposition during the King's tenure had scant chance to exercise any authority. Attempted negotiations with the Maoist opposition in 2004 came to nothing, according to Freedom House. Are all people able to access political power : I give zero points in response to this question, as the monarchic reign throughout the bulk of the noughties in Nepal implies that power was concentrated in the hands of an elite few; not even the Maoists, nor former Nepalese representatives, had access to political power during the King's reign. Is there a free and effective media to hold power to account : I have chosen one point for this question as, according to Freedom House Nepal experienced a restricted media environment during 2002-8. This included harassment and arrestment of reporters critical of the (King's) government and/or supportive of the Maoist opposition. Self-censorship also occurred, as a natural consequence of such persecution. More specifically, an 'ordinance'gave the King and his government the power to keep unwelcome media in check. In this way it is clear that this environment left no room for media that might otherwise have 'held power to account'during this period. Does it uphold rule of law : according to Freedom House, the maintenance of Nepal's rule of law significantly improved from 2006 onwards; however, the rule of law saw a peak in its 'deterioration' in the previous year. More specifically, Freedom House reports that Gyanendra's administration paid little heed to Nepal's Supreme Court's orders. Thus, it is implied in this information that the rule of law throughout the period I've studied was less than binding; thus, I give this question with one point. Do its citizens have human rights, including freedom of Assembly, Speech and Mobility : I have chosen one point for this question, as, according to Freedom House, free assembly suffered 'occasional restriction;' demonstrations in 2005 were combatted by Nepalese police; many protestors were arrested. As may be inferred from my answer to the earlier question on media freedom, free expression was limited: more specifically, according to Freedom House, both its constitution and a 'Press and publications Act' prohibited expression which was unsavoury to the monarchy. Furthermore, in the period before 2006, Nepal failed to honour basic human rights, especially insofar as its police committed all manner of abuses, including 'extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, rapes, and torture (of suspected Maoists.) ' Free, independent, fair judiciary : Freedom House reports that despite a perception of independence regarding Nepal's Supreme Court, Gyanendra's administration came to disregard its orders. According to the same source, lower courts were more susceptible to 'pressure' and corruption. As a result of this general ineffectiveness and unfairness I answer this question with one point. Institutions to hold executive to account : I answer this question with one point. As mentioned above, the executive enjoyed virtual impunity insofar as the media and judiciary were about powerless to constrain Gyanendra. More specifically, the corruption among officialdom noted by Freedom House during Gynaendra's reign wasn't usually met with prosecution; however pretences at propriety were made via the creation of 'anticorruption regulations.' Again, with the abovementioned improvement in 2006 of Nepal's rule of law, so too did the implementation of such regulations improve. Equal treatment for minorities : according to Freedom House, various minorities alleged discrimination during the King's rule (as per the 'US State Department's Report on International Religious Freedom' ) ; furthermore, prior to 2007, at least, Freedom House reports that Christians faced discrimination before Nepalese law. However I answer with two points for this question, given official 'constitutional provisions that ban caste-based discrimination.' Confidence in answers : I have used various credible sources, especially the BBC and Freedom House. How corrupt was Nepal throughout this period : as mentioned above, 'anticorruption regulations' were introduced during the King's rule, however a lack of prosecution of top officials, as reported by Freedom House, undermines their credibility. But, again as reported above, prosecutions increased as Gyanendra's rule wore on. Freedom House reports that Transparency International ranked Nepal 121 of 163 nations in a 2006 index; this ranking supports the case for Nepal's corruptness. In consequence I answer this question with a one, rather than a zero, given the lack of explicit accounts I found regarding corruption in Nepal's top tiers -as mentioned earlier, Freedom House noted corruption among lower courts. Types of corruption : I answer this question by ticking 'bribe-taking'and 'special privileges granted to politically-connected people;'the first tick is based on an inference regarding evidence cited above that refers simply to 'corruption'in lower Nepalese courts; the second tick I based on King Gyanendra's appointment of a royalist-supporting administration during his reign, as according to Freedom House data.

Furthermore many press workers have been detained and mistreated by state officials, resulting in Freedom House declaring the media in South Sudan to not be free. Q. 26, 28 The President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, has been exempt from much of the transitional constitutions conditions, and has sacked his entire cabinet in what seems to be a consolidation of power. He also has considerable power over the judiciary, as do many other politicians and officers in the armed forces. Finally, the state legislature moved the upcoming election from 2015, to 2018, therefore making the country without an election in its history, and without one as a territory since 2010.

This is due to a lack of accountability through not having proper checks and balances against those in power. The Human rights commission is unable to follow through in its role as it is understaffed, with a lack of resources, and is therefore unable to conduct investigations into human rights breaches.

Furthermore the President has continually voiced opposition to sexual rights (http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article35815) . Finally, in 2015, the NGO Minority Rights Group International lists South Sudanese minority groups as the 9th most threatened people in the world. In regards to question 32 and 33, due to South Sudan's developing stage, and infancy in terms of national history, it is likely that corruption is widespread. South Sudanese officials have been said to have stolen much of the states financial assests, and laundered money into offshore, foreign bank accounts. Whether or not President Kiir is involved in this is unknown.

Political rights 2: people are required to be of 18 years of age when voting the only limitations on voting are that you need to be a citizenship of Namibia (by birth) or child of at least one parent born in Namibia or residence in the country for at least 4 years prior to the date of registration as elector. Political rights 3: There are opposition parties but the South West African People Organization has won with more than 50% of votes for consecutive years. And opposition parties numbers dwindling.

Also there media coverage is among the best according to minoritygroups.org and are the freest among the continent with no reports of discrimination against minority groups. Civil liberties 1: on the freedom house index Namibia scored an 3 out of 7 which is directly in the middle which would indicate that Namibia does consider their civil liberties.

It would be assumed that human rights are often violated but freedom house reports that Namibia has some of the best although there are reports of forces beating citizens and Angolan refugees. Civil Liberties 3: Namibia scores a 49/100 which is half way of being clean or being or very corrupt. This would indicate that there are some forms of corruption and political influence in judiciary. Civil Liberties 4: Ombudsman was entrenched when the Constitution of the Republic of Namibia came into operation on 21 March 1990.

"Cabo Verde",1990,2001,"""Not much corruption detected""","I chose to study in between 1990 and 2001 because the Movement for Democracy party was established in 1990 and in power from 1991-2001. Freedom House only dates back to 1998 so it did not provide me with any information before then but it claims that since the transition to multiparty elections in 1991, there was free and fair elections with universal suffrage. [1] The fact that Movement for Democracy lost power in 2001 to opposition PAICV with a 12-vote margin [2] indicates that there is a good chance that opposition can get into power. This win did not cause any violent backlash, and was accepted peacefully. It is stated 'having two parties of fairly equal strength, as opposed to the ruling party dominance so common in Africa, has ensured lively debate in the National Assembly and meant that no government has been able to be complacent.' [3] While all people were able to form a party and run for government, Cape Verde is marked with significant poverty and the majority of people did not have the resources to offer material incentives for supporting constitutional rule. [4] This means that while people are free to gain power in theory, significant poverty does not permit such freedoms. In the test there was no option that represented this poverty factor. Given the ratings of Freedom House, I would have expected that the media was free. However, the main media outlets are owned by the state, which brings a degree of self-censorship. Other media is allowed, although in 1998 the government shut down a radio station that was partially owned by an opposition politician [5] . This was not a common occurrence. The government generally upheld basic human rights but there was significant societal discrimination especially domestic violence towards women and mistreatment of children. Poverty exacerbated these violent acts and while there was government legislation to ameliorate these problems, they failed to properly implement and enforce these policies. [6] Again, significant poverty disabled the government from enforcing any minimum wage or workplace policies. Many people opposed to the government assembled in peaceful protests and the government did not inhibit these. Freedom of religion was generally upheld and the government did not enforce any religious beliefs. There were also two private human rights groups in Cape Verde that hold the government accountable for human right breaches. [7] However, in the year of 1995, there were no investigations carried out. The judiciary operated independently and was not significantly coerced by the government. This is illustrated in a judge refusing an influential minister's allegations about an independent journalist. Also journalists were successful in gaining compensation after unfair dismissal from a government owed media company. [8] Police were also subject to the same laws as civilians. [9] I could not find much more information to answer this question. However, the judiciary was overburdened with cases and from 1998 there has been a move to make it more efficient- between 2000-2005 there was a 15 percent increase in number of judges. [10] The government have to declare their interests and income, making for a more transparent government [11] Through Google search engine, Google scholar and Victoria library database, I could not find much more information on corruption during this time other than it was the least corrupt in Africa, which most likely indicates that corruption was not significant in Cape Verde. However, I find this difficult to believe given significant poverty in country.

"Russian Federation",2000,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Political Rights: Question 1: It is commonly known that the election in Russia are not fair, however its often found that actual voter ballets are not manipulates (usually) and the outcome of the election generally represent the will of the people. However, the fairness and international standards are not meet by agreement of most of the international community including NGO's such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) who agreed that the 2004 election of Putin did not meet international standards of elections, particularly due to media bias. In 2012 the term before an election was lengthened to 6 years from for and in 2011 executive elections from 4 to 5 years under Putin's order. Question 2: There is Universal Suffrage in Russia as of age 18. Question 3: The political system in Russia is a multi-party system, however the pro-president party (United Russia) control more than two thirds of the Duma and put majority support in for president priorities. The Russian Constitution provides citizens the opportunity to change their government peacefully. However, it is commonly known that this is easier said than done. Most elections are unfairly weighted in favour of a the party that is already in power at this time United Russia, although the president is not directly accountable to the party, there is mutual uses for one another. The party strongly backs the president. As mentioned the leading has an unfair advantage in terms of publically, there does not leave much room for political change. Question 4: The executive levels of government in Russia are held most commonly by rich white older men that are loyal to Putin. The system of appointment of positions at governmental level is more or less controlled by the president (Putin) . The president nominates that Prime Minister, who appoints the federal assembly, and confirms the constitutional assembly and members of the Duma (Who are all nominated by the president) . This makes it increasingly difficult to enter the government at this level, unless you are a loyal friend or former Security forces co-worker of Putin, he relies on these personal relationships in order to maintain power, as Gorbachev and Yeltsin before him. Question 5: Transparency International has ranked Russia low in terms of Freedom of Press (142/179) . Although print press remains majorly pluralistic, radio and television media freedom is very limited. There have been many cases of infringement by the government on the freedom of the press right. Mainly in terms of election coverage skewering the opponents'ability to campaign and positively portraying their own. HHR, 2010 notes that independent media networks are, 'faced with continuing financial difficulties, as well as pressure from the government and large privately companies with links to the government, many media organizations saw their autonomy further weakened' (HHR, 2010) . Civil Liberties: Question 1: Although many of the principles of democracy are outline to be protected in the Russian Constitution the political system, corruption and lack of accountability means that the principles are generally not upheld. Question 2: Government institutions used to maintain human rights in Russia were relatively weak, including freedom of speech and media as mentioned earlier. The Russian government has to some extent maintained the human rights of citizens in some regions in of the country. However, human rights are weakly maintained in other less economically prosperous areas, and have even worsened in some in the years. Overall, human rights standards in the country are poor. Protection of human rights remains relatively high in the public sphere. Question 3: The constitution has an independent judiciary. Unfortunately the judiciary is usually driven by the decision of the executive. The judiciary does not work as a fair of effective counter balances or monitor for the other branches of the government, as mentioned before the members are made up of people approved by the president. Judges are subject to influence constantly by executives, military and Special Forces. It lacks the resources to be effective and is riddled with corruption, threats and intimidation. Question 4: As mentioned earlier the lay out of the political system in Russia makes it difficult to have any kind of transparency or form of accountability in the country. Along with all the corruption the executive has a huge grasp on power. HRR states 'Changes in the parliamentary election laws and move from election to nomination by the president of regional governors further strengthened the power of the executive branch and, together with media restrictions, a compliant state Duma, short comings in recent national elections, law enforcement corruption, and political pressure on the judiciary, raised concerns about the erosion in accountability of government leaders to the people' (HRR, 2010) Question 5: The constitution prohibits discrimination based on nationality. However, Roma persons and dark skinned persons commonly face discrimination in both the public sphere and by the government, Muslims and Jewish also face prejudice and social discrimination in the country. The HHR notes that a informally study of Africans (mostly students and refugees) in Russia in 2002 found, 'indicated that nearly two thirds reported having been physically attacked in Moscow because of their race. Fifty four percent were verbally insulted by the police because of their race. The 180 students questioned reported 204 attacks, 160 of them reported to the police, resulting in 2 convictions.'

"Iran, Islamic Republic of",1989,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","For this case, I have elected to evaluate Iran based upon a timeframe of between 1989 and 2015. These dates correspond to the (contemporary) rule of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, the second Supreme Leader of Iran. Ali Khamenei was elected as Supreme Leader by a committee of Islamic theologians (the Assembly of Experts) appointed by his predecessor, Ruhollah Khomeini, who was responsible for the overthrow of the previous ruling imperial dynasty in 1979 and established a uniquely theocratic-democratic republic in its place. This time frame was chosen predominantly because of the consolidatory and transitional nature of the regime under Ruhollah Khomeini, during which time the Iranian government faced much internal and external conflict (see the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988), and in which time the civil and political policies of the Iranian state cannot be considered as having yet become stabilized enough as to constitute an institutionalized regime. Hence, we have elected to base our evaluation upon a timeframe which corresponds to the rule of Ali Khamenei, which offers a framework in which the policies of the Iranian state have remained both effective and stable. In our classification of the Iranian regime, many of the answers given are based upon evidence sourced from various international reports (see links below), including those conducted by Transparency International, Freedom House, the Wall Street Journal, and the Human Rights Watch, as well as from the United States Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Each of these reports generally indicate that the Iranian regime constitutes high levels of corruption, censorship, and the denial or suppression of civil and political rights. Consequentially, many answers were given a scoring of 0 out of a possible 3, particularly those which concern the independence of the media, of the judiciary, and the rights of minorities. According to international reports, no election held during our timeframe can be considered either free or fair. In one report, Freedom House notes how Iranâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Guardian Council â<U+0080><U+0093> a constitutionally mandated committee charged with overseeing obedience to the constitution â<U+0080><U+0093> has on occasion used its powers to arbitrarily disqualify opposition candidates; in one case, in 2012, for instance, the Guardian Council is stated to have disqualified one-third of candidates on the basis of dubious accusations of drug-smuggling, espionage, and heresy. Other reports also indicate that opposition politicians are often subject to harassment or harsh restrictions, and that certain political parties have been forcibly dissolved on the basis of their reformist beliefs. Religious and cultural minorities are also generally forbidden from attaining high-ranking positions in government. Furthermore, despite universal suffrage being afforded under the Iranian constitution, reports such as those conducted by Freedom House and the United States Department of State indicate that in practice universal suffrage is often violated by the government. In one instance, Freedom House reports that women were arbitrarily disqualified from participating in the 2006 elections. However, because there is some evidence of political pluralism in the Iranian Parliament, with opposition groups such as the Reformists generally holding a significant portion of Parliament, and because specific restrictions upon universal suffrage are arbitrarily and irregularly imposed (and thus difficult to consistently account for), many questions concerning political rights were scored as either 1 or 2. According to the Iranian constitution, the Supreme Leader directly appoints the heads of the judiciary, as well as the heads of state-run media institutions and security forces. Consequentially, the judiciary and media are demonstrably not independent of the government. Further, reports indicate that the media â<U+0080><U+0093> both state-run and independent â<U+0080><U+0093> is subject to considerable censorship (both self-censorship and government censorship), with reports indicating the harassment and the restriction of the mobility of journalists, and of laws which prohibit the criticizing of Islamic doctrine and of past and present leaders of the state. Hence, questions relating to the independence of the media and the judiciary, and of their use as an effective check on power, were scored 0. However, in spite of this, questions relating to the rule of law and on the existence of effective checks on power were scored 2. This is, in spite of reports which suggest that the rule of law is weak in Iran, based upon the existence of tutelary institutions such as the Guardian Council which serve as an arbitrator of Sharia law, upon which the Iranian legal code and constitution is based, which act as a legal check on both the power of the Supreme Leader and on the power of the Iranian Parliament. Although Iranian laws may be contrary to laws standardized in the international community (and they may be generally considered Draconian), they are nonetheless upheld by such independent bodies as the Guardian Council, and hence the rule of law is generally upheld. However, because this perspective is limited to the application of Sharia law, and thus room for the breaching of secular laws exists (and is reported in some cases in which the government pressures lawyers to drop cases, and in cases where the constitutional rights of minorities are wilfully violated), the regime was afforded a score of 2 instead of 3, noting the possibility for significant breaches. Human rights in Iran are also reportedly severely limited. Although freedoms to assembly and movement are guaranteed under the constitution, these are often limited in practice, with reports indicating that assembling in opposition of Islamic doctrine is prohibited (labelled as â<U+0080><U+0098>counter-revolutionaryâ<U+0080><U+0099>) and on occasion responded to with violence. Other freedoms are not guaranteed, however, such as the freedom of association, expression, and religion, and homosexuality and apostasy are both punishable by death. Reportedly, discrimination against non-Islamic minorities (particularly non-Judeo-Christian and non-Zoroastrian minorities) is routine, and many such minorities are forbidden from practicing their faith. For these reasons (as well as the prohibition against non-Muslims from attaining senior political posts), questions relating to the protection of human rights and of empowering minorities were scored 0. Finally, reports corroborate that corruption is widespread within the Iranian regime. According to these reports, cases of widespread embezzlement and fraud have been uncovered (including a significant case in 2013 involving a group called the Fatemi Circle, which was responsible for embezzling the state treasury), and high-ranking members of the Iranian government have sought to abolish anti-corruption agencies so as to reduce the transparency of government (this was the case under the Ahmadinejad administration, which, according to Freedom house, abolished several independent anti-corruption â<U+0080><U+009C>watchdogsâ<U+0080>). Furthermore, high-ranking members of the government have been indicated in acts of fraud, such as in 2011 in a pervasive case of fraud involving the fraudulent purchasing of state-owned businesses. Hence, the question regarding the prevalence of corruption in the Iranian regime was scored 0.

"Chad",1991,1997,"""Condoning illegal business dealings""","For the regime classification exercise I was assigned two countries, one of which was Chad, 1994. I chose the period of time between 1991, when general General Idriss Déby Itno became the President of Chad after approval of a national charter by the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS) ; up to 1997, the time of the countries first multi-party presidential election. During this time period, political parties were legalized, . Following his rise to power in December 1990, Debybegan to gradually restore the basic functions of government and entered into agreements with the world bank and International Monetry Fund (IMF), showing intent from Deby to uphold a government focused in the wider goals of the nation. Suffrage in Chad is granted to all individuals over the age of 18. However, as 1996 was the first multi-party election held in Chad, and there remains speculation as to its level of transparency, I took as educated guess when answering the questions on the existance of an effective opposition, and universal suffrage. With regards to the question on access to political power, I rated Chad a 1 out of 3, this is because the president has the power to appoint the prime minister, and cabinet. He may also exercise considerable influence over the appointment of judges, generals, officials and heads of firms. When beginning research for this exercise regarding Chad, I struggled to find sources, and therefore I am not confident in many on answers provided. In particular I struggled to answer the final two questions on Corruption, and made an educated guess using the little information I gathered regarding the President Derby, and Chad's polity.

"Azerbaijan",1990,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Azerbaijan is an intresting country to classify, as the period of study in this case represents the entirety of the time the country has exisitsted in its current form, having declared independece from the Soviet Union in 1991. This is both a positive, as it means all releveant data is mostly available through the internet, but also a negative, as the country has not had time to politically mature, and the sample size for elections is limited. Regardless, it is clear from all sources that Azerbaijan is by no means a free and fair society or electoral system. For the first section, to establish the methods and rules around the electoral system, publically available information lsited by the Central Intelligence Agency was used and cross checked against a human rights NGO. Both returned the same results, and thus I am satisfied that my findings on the systematic makeup of the system are sound. Questions on corruption, political and civil rights form the majority of this dataset, and are easily answearble. Pratically all sources consulted, including two seperate NGO reports, agree that there is strong systematic corruption and bias within Azerbaijan. The governing house is made up of single constituencys, and has no real power or speration from the executive branch, and a recent referendum removed term limits from both these seats and the presidency. The first elections after the millitary coup in 1993 resulted in the incumbent winning a suspicious 99% of the vote. In the most recent elections, the incumbent President, the son of the coup leader in 1993 allegedly won 84% of the vote, with the closest opposition party winning just 5%. The same election suffered widespread rigging allegations after results naming 2013 candidates were pushed to a mobile app run by the goverment BEFORE voting had begun. The goverment claimed the data was from a previous election (Technically an Investigation, meriting the Question 29 Answer), but the data pushed included 2013 candidates. Corruption and political pressure is widespread in the Judicury and public service, as well as the media. All of these are considered subserviant to the executive branch, and while the consitution does allow for indepentent media and judiciary, in practise they are heavily censored or pressured. Defamation remains a criminal offence, despite the goverment promising to decrimanalise it in 2012. Freedom house is scathing in their report, noting that random arrest and detention without charge is common, especially for political oppositon figures. Additionally, the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of regligion are heavily supressed, with 'non-traditional' religions requiring registrations, and assembly heavily supressed especially for opposition parties. I am very confident in the answers given for Azerbaijan. For this investigation I read reports by both Freedom House and Human Rights watch, investagatory articles by several intenational news agencys, and consulted data available from several govermental organisations such as the Central Intelligence Agency. None of these sources offered any information to contrast the widely accepted understanding of the state of the country both politically and socially, meaning I am confident to say my answers reflect reality. Although several other sources were consulted in various ways, the primary evidence for these answers can be found: Reports by NGOs: Freedom House: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/azerbaijan#.VV7lD0-eDRY HRW: http://www.hrw.org/europecentral-asia/azerbaijan Govermental: Central Intelligence Agency https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html News: Washington Post: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/09/oops-azerbaijan-released-election-results-before-voting-had-even-started/ Aljazzera Reporting: http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/azerbaijan.html",1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,7,5,12
"Tunisia",1987,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","This period was chosen because although it was a repressive period in history, it was extremely stable. After his rise to power in 1987, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali promised competitive elections, democracy and a better Tunisia than was seen under his predecessor, Bourguiba. Under his 23 year rule, the authoritarianism because more pronounced, and repression stronger than Tunisia had seen. Originally supported by foreign leaders for educational reform and economic growth, Ben Ali fled the country after mass protests in 2010. Given how recent the overthrow of Ben Ali was, there is a significant amount of information about the end of his regime, and still a large amount about the regime itself. A particularly useful source on Ben Ali-s Regime is a thesis by Logan, who went to Tunisia to interview those who had lived under the regime. This gave great insight into life under Ben Ali and provided the basis for many of my answers, supported by other sources. Question 21 Although there were consistent elections during the regime of Ben Ali, there was no chance of any opposition receiving any real power. In the 1989 and 1994 elections, Ben Ali had no opponents. (Department of State) .Even once the multiparty era began, there was no possibility of gaining a majority. It was a way to avoid criticism and appear inclusive - a façade of democracy and a tool to appease those who wanted to see opposition. (Logan) . Results during these elections were inconceivable in free and fair elections. The 'majority list'system meant that whichever party got the highest number of votes would receive all the seats in that district (the RCP) . This was a way of blocking out minority parties. Elections were there to reinforce the regimes hold over the state, they were not a way of distributing power amongst the people. In 1999 rallies were banned outside polling booths to further the appearance of democracy and candidates were selected (by Ben Ali) to run against him in the Presidential elections. Question 22 Despite the repressive regime, universal suffrage existed under Ben Ali. In fact, Tunisia since it's independence has been consistently pro gender equality, especially when considering it's geographical location in the Arab world. (Department of State) The only restriction on suffrage prevented those serving in the military or internal security forces from voting. Universal suffrage may have been Ben Ali's way of improving his façade of democracy. Question 23 As Logan calls it, Ben Ali only had 'décor opposition'. The opposition had no hope of gaining power, despite Ben Ali's National Pact promising democracy and competitiveness. Many opposition parties were created by the regime to improve appearances. Real opposition parties suffered from lack of funds, infiltration, and the threat of punishment. They were also persecuted to reduce the support among civil society. Media published by the opposition was hard to find. The Islamist 'Ennhada'was refused permission to run and exist. Sadiki mentioned that the change to multi-party rule was a change 'from single party rule to multi party hegemony'-essentially, other parties existed but they had no hope of overtaking the RCD. Question 24 Anyone hoping to have access to political power had to be close to Ben Ali, and support the regime. This meant that they did not truly have power because they would simply be supporting Ben Ali's policies. Close supporters and family of the President had access to political power. His wife Leila Trabelsi's family in particular were powerful, with rumours that she would take over the Presidency due to abdication or death. (Logan) . Information on this question was less obvious. Given the nature of the regime it is assumed that political power was extremely unevenly spread. Question 25 Ben Ali was more open about media at the very beginning of his reign than at the end -perhaps reflecting how progressively worse his regime became for the people of Tunisia. After two years in power, he began to attack journalists. The regime may not have owned all the media outlets (especially after technological advancements such as the internet), but the regime had full control of news vendors, meaning only pro-regime media could be sold, and anyone hoping to purchase otherwise would be reported to the regime. Journalists had two choices -working for the regime media, or risking your wellbeing and working undercover. Websites were blocked (although people got around this by proxy), and much foreign information was inaccessible. Media was strictly monitored. Ben Ali even created a propaganda machine, announcing achievements and skewing figures in favour of the regime (Logan) . In 2009 Reporters Without Borders ranked Tunisia 154/173 in their World Press Freedom list. Question 26 It was difficult to find appropriate information in order to answer this question. Worldwide Governance Indicators show that in 2003, Tunisia was in the 50 th percentile for rule of law, and in 2008 when it was next measured, it was in the 58 th percentile -showing some improvement. However there are also indicators that the large security force was not to destroying homes to instill fear in the population. Surveillance was common and supporters of the opposition were frequently harassed. Question 27 Human rights in Ben Ali's Tunisia were severely suppressed by the regime. In 2010 FreedomHouse ranked Tunisia as Not Free, with a Freedom Rating of 6/7 (seven being the worst) and political rights a 7/7. Despite a Code of Personal Status promising an improvement in human rights and Freedom of Assembly and Association and Freedom of Expression from the Bourguiba regime, Ben Ali did not follow through. During Islamist protests in 1990-1992, 8000 Muslims were arrested. Raids and torture were not uncommon against Muslims. Declaring oneself as 'neutral'towards politics was considered dissent -citizens had to actively support the regime. Unlike similar regimes in China and Syria, where the government could be criticized, this was not possible in Tunisia, as to criticize the government was to criticize Ben Ali himself ( Logan) . Human rights activists in Tunisia are suppressed. Prisoners can be detained without reason and torture is prevalent. The government preventing certain groups from existing, and bugging known locations of groups hinders Freedom of Assembly and Association. Freedom of Expression is clearly violated, as any dissenting remark was dangerous. As Logan found while interviewing Tunisians after Ben Ali fled, they were still hesitant to criticize the regime. Question 28 According to the US Department of State in 2010, the judiciary was 'nominally independent'. Essentially, the judiciary was made to appear independent from the executive, but it was clear that Ben Ali had significant influence over the judiciary, as he also did over the legislature. The Minister of Justice and Human Rights appointed all judges. Bribe-taking was rife in the 'Reshwa State' (Logan), so those who had money also had power within the judiciary. Question 29 Any processes to hold the regime accountable only existed on paper. The legislative body may have been bicameral, but given the lack of opposition, there was no accountability. It was rare for any changes to be made to prospective bills (US State Department) . Any inquiries would have been seen as criticisms of Ben Ali. Question 30 The most persecuted group in Tunisia were Islamists. Originally, the regime was not hostile to Islamists who had previously been discriminated against. Given it's reputation as a secular state, religious based political parties were banned. However the regime still allowed to Islamist Party Ennahda or An-Hahdha operate until 1991. At this point is was deemed a terrorist organisation, and thousands were arrested (State Department) . Some marginalised groups forfeit rights for food. Although there may have been other minorities facing unequal treatment under the regime, it was not significant enough to appear in journal articles and sources upon which this is based. Question 32 Corruption was huge under the Ben Ali regime. A small group surrounding Ben Ali, depended on the regime for their extreme wealth. State resources were funneled into the hands of those in power. False figures were given to international institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF (Logan) . Welfare was given to the wealthy. The poor got poorer through coercion, and the government demanding large percentages of any profits. The most obvious example is Muhammed Bouzazi, whose suicide is often named as the spark of the Arab Spring. Bouzazi was not allowed to get his scales back from the government, and could not run his small fruit stand. The state was known as a 'Rashwa' or Bribing state. Embezzling was huge among elites. Infrastructure deteriorated as allocated funds were misused. After the revolution in 2011, figures began to emerge, with Logan stating that the ruling family embezzled one third of the state budget -with his wife's family the main culprits. Society could barely eat. WikiLeaks in 2010 put the number in the tens of billions. Question 33 Bribes were the most common form of corruption, hence the name Rashwa State. Ben Ali himself co-opted several industries and the ruling family liquidated to avoid taxes -fraud at the highest level. The ruling family monopolized the economy and assets were seized from the working class without explanation. It is unclear whether there was fraud by private citizens against the government. It can be assumed that this would be a huge risk given the importance of capital to the government. Anonymous, Tunisia, Department of State Publication: Background Notes Series, (2010) .

"Thailand",1995,2005,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Freedom House reports were also used to inform the answers on Thailand's case. The confidence in which these answers were given varies, as I often found that the range of possible answers were limited and were not exactly suitable to the case. This will be further explained: Political Rights Question One was answered with: ' There are elections for the executive and the legislature but there is a very low likelihood of government change via elections' Although these answers did not fit the case well, this answer was given due to the Freedom House (2003) report which highlighted that although Thais can change their governments through elections, that they are marred by fraud, irregularities, and some political killings. In previous elections - such as the January 2001 balloting - candidates gave money to voters in order to buy votes. Question Two: was straight-forward, since the 1933 elections there had been universal suffrage in Thailand. Although there are now restrictions including, being over the age of 18, being a citizen and being registered to vote. Question Three: as shown in Question One, although Thais can change their government democratically -Freedom House (2005) used the August 2004 election of an opposition Democratic candidate as the governor of Bangkok, as an example - there are major obstacles such as widespread official corruption that undermines the ability for opposition to have a fair standing in elections. Question Four: was answered with 'Many people have access to political power, with some exceptions' According to Freedom House (2002) report, roughly half of the 700,000 to 880,000 members of hill tribes reportedly lack citizenship, which in turn, leaves them ineligible to vote, or even own land and be covered under labour laws. Although, the government in 2000 eased the rules for hill tribe members to be eligible for and obtain citizenship, it is still unclear as to how many of these hill tribe peoples have benefited from the changes. Majority of citizens did have access to political power, with non-governmental organizations representing farmers, labourers, women, students and human rights more broadly. Question Five: Although the 2002 Freedom House report stated that during Thaksin's reign, Thai newspapers freely criticized government policies and reported allegations of official corruption and human rights abuses, the opposition Democratic Party alleged that some papers might have toned down their criticisms because of the advertisements they received from state companies and Thaskin's Shin Corporation and its subsidiaries. Freedom House highlighted that these journalists may have exercised some self-censorship regarding national security issues etc. Furthermore, the 2005 Freedom House report highlighted that print press had come under attack, not through formal censorship, but through political intimidation, libel suits, and the threat of lost corporate and government advertising revenues, which resulted in media companies carrying large debts. Civil Liberties Question One: The leaders of the state are not subject to the rule of law, this was more of an educated guess based on the information Freedom House reports (2005) provided, such as the pervasive and widespread official corruption, involving both bureaucrats demanding bribes in exchange for routine services and law enforcement officials being paid off to ignore trafficking and other illegal activities. Criminal charges were often laid against political oppositions as well, which undermines the legitimacy of state officials. Question Two: Was answered with 'Partial rights exist, but there is still heavy suppression and monitoring'. Freedom House (2005) reports highlighted that Thailand's Constitution provided for freedom of assembly and association, and that the government generally respected these rights in practice, according to the US State Department human rights report for 2004. In addition to this, the constitution also allowed for the government to restrict free expression on national security, public order, and other grounds (Freedom House, 2002) . Domestic Violence and trafficking of thousands of Thai women and children were (and still remain) a serious and pervasive problem of Thailand, although according to the Freedom House (2002) and U.S. State Department reports, the police did not vigorously enforce laws to bring perpetrators to justice, thus the law enforcement agencies were widely perceived as incapable. Although this is not an example of states suppression of human rights, it still provides an example of state incompetency and how this indirectly perpetuates the suppression of (certain groups of) people's rights. Question Three: 'The judiciary sometimes operated independently, but it is susceptible to undue influence and corruption', Freedom House (2005) reports state that the judiciary is generally regarded as independent, but is sometimes subject to corruption. The 2002 report also stated that The judiciary also lacks a sufficient number of qualified judges and has huge case backlogs. Defendants generally receive adequate due process rights. Question Four: Does this country have effective processes in order to hold governing regime accountable? This was difficult to find information on whether processes put in place were enacted effectively. Thus, from the information gathered on the corruption that was rife within state officials in the regime, I assumed there were no effective processes that held them or the governing regime accountable. Although, I thought it was important to note that the opposition party (Democratic Party) in 2005 often brought to light the issues within their current ruling party, keeping the party check. Question Five: Does this country uphold the right to equal treatment and due process for minority groups? Although the constitution includes basic rights which the government generally uphold, as explained in other answers, many groups are often neglected by the government. Maybe not directly, but the incompetence of the government allows for the unequal treatment of certain (including minority) groups. Thai women and children are often neglected by the state, and many police, soldiers, local officials and immigration officers reportedly either are involved in trafficking or take bribes to ignore it. As well as this, Muslims in the South have long complained of discrimination in jobs, education, and business opportunities (Freedom House, 2005) .

"Solomon Islands",1995,2002,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","The time analysis in which the Solomon Islands has been ranked accordingly, is the mid-1990 to early 2000. In this particular period, the Solomon Islands was doomed to become a failed state, after tensions between the Malaita's and Guadalcanal populations intensified. Increasing violence saw the failure of the state to protect victims of violence, or implement law and order. (Yoldi, n.d) So, although the government remained legitimate, their incompetency meant that citizens were unrestricted to become violent, oppressive, liberated etc. to fuel an escalating failed state. For these reasons, it becomes difficult to assess the political rights and civil liberties of its citizens, when the government cannot exercise power to enforce these mechanisms. During this period, elections remained. However, it became inaccessible for people to vote as a result of the violence that occurred. People had also lost a sense of political efficacy towards the government, as a result of a deteriorating economy, public institutions, state capacity and the enforcement of law and order. (Kere, 2015) Furthermore, elections were held for the sake of it without making much difference in the political status. While the freedom of media exists, it is highly concentrated in the urban capital of Honiara. (Kabutaulaka, n.d) Eighty-five percent of its population are located in rural areas of the country, without access to avenues of political information and discussion. Generally, people would vote based on candidates that could help them and their families. Voting was also driven by areas where candidates possessed power to punish those who didn't vote for him, as well as a constraint by the authority of local constituencies. 'Nearly ninety-nine percent of People's Survey Respondents answered that they were 'told to vote for them', suggesting they had little choice.' (Steeves, 1996, p. 130) However, in general terms all citizens have the freedom to vote. In saying that, the countries'government system and party liability tends to be....'highly unstable, continually in flux, and open in persistent challenge through the mechanism of votes of no-confidence, which feature throughout the term of an elected government.' (Steeves, 1996, p. 120) The Isatabu Freedom Movement and Malaita Eagle Force during ethnic violence opposed the government at the time. However, they were too weak and lacked sustainable resources to transition into power. In the case of civil liberties, citizens have access to fundamental human rights. However, this contradicts with the reality of poverty, unemployment, the lack of access to basic amenities, education, health etc. This lack of provisions of basic human rights have been drivers of ethnic violence and desperation for solutions to socio-economic grievances. (Reid, 2008) This is why I ranked it a one. The judiciary system during this period was weak, incompetent and on the verge of collapse. They had lost authority to perform its rightful duties and posed no threat to its citizens. However, this caused an upsurge of tension from civil societies, business groups and the international community led to the Townsville Peace Agreement in 2000, between the Isatabu Freedom Movement, Malaita Eagle Force and the government to create a framework for consolidating peace. (Yoldi, n.d) While the government had no mechanisms in place to hold them accountable, their lack of accountability propelled a pressure from below. This lack of accountability was also conveyed in the discrimination between minorities and the continued suppression of the Malaita's by the Guadalcanal people without any government prosecution. (Yoldi, n.d) Ultimately, the regime classification system was analysed in accordance with the political environment of the Solomon Islands in the mid-1990 to early 2000, particularly during the period of racial tensions and civil unrest, lawlessness and threat of a failed state. Where peace talks began in 2000, violence remained but conditions were improving. In 2003, the Freedom House analysis of civil liberties and political rights in the Solomon Islands resulted as partly free (3/7) . 'The Townsville Peace Agreement has lessened the violence but today the Solomon's is a bankrupt nation where the politics are fragile and the people are trying to adopt some semblance of normal life again' . (Reid, 2008 p.1) In reality, the livelihoods of their people must be improved in order to suggest that peace is consolidate. Ultimately, people are still vulnerable to violence because of corruption and the lack of investments in its citizens living conditions. Reference: Kabutaulaka, T. T. (n.d) .

"Korea, Democratic People's Republic of",2012,2012,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","Question 21 - The electoral sytem in North Korea, at this time period (and also now), is basically a farce. Since the instillation of the Kim Dynasty - and the 'line of succesion' system, it has allready been decided who would lead the country. Parties are in place, and the fact that during their electoral process that only one cadidate is avaliable, makes it that much more difficult for opposition to happen. Question 22 - Using the information gathered in the previous question, the fact that only a singular candidate is avaliable shows how restrictive the electoral system is. Factors and ideals to consider is that all North Koreans citizens are indoctrinated in their daily lives by the Kim Dynasty/goverment officals - it speaks for itelf that people would just go with the flow - pr depending on political persusaion - that they would want to stay with the current system for reasons of comfort . (the idea of comfort/staying with what is easy rather than being practical) Question 23 - Parties and a 'pseudo' oppostion are in place - but it is ultimately a facade. Considering previous statements, it is near to impossible for any form of opposition or challengers to take plac ein North Korea, at this given period, or in the near future. Question 24 - Power is highly concentrated amongst a select few, often hand-picked by the leader himself. Note, it is also common to see those who are selected, are those who dedicate their entire life/being to the regime as well. It si neccesary also to consider how isolated North Korea is from the outside world as well as it is at a national level. The population were, and still are, isolated fom political levels, as to avoid potential competiton and so on for power. Question 25 - Media is owned by the state and tightly regualted by the state. The detah of Kim-Jong-Il, and the succesion of his son Kim-Jong-Un, were highly publicised events (basically on repeat, almost like a conditioning and indoctrination process) . With media being state owned, it was near to impossible to be independent. At this time, the media also, whilst endorsing the Kim regime, also used the media as a form for defemation against defectors from the state and the United States. Any form (which was unlikely) of defemation against the state, would result in persecution and arbitary punishment. Question 26 - The rule of law was virtually non-exsistent,a dn did not apply to the elite in power. It was applied more, and rather forcefully on citizens, whereas the misuse of power by the head of state, was completely ignored, and if challanged, oppostion were shut down, and faced harsh punishments and even faced corporal punishment. Question 27 - In theory, they did at this given time. The reality is that, being in the self-imposed isolated state it was in, and still continues to be in, access to civil rights were barred off from the citizens completely. The 'line of succesion' system also violates human and civil rights. Citizens had no participation or say in who was to be their new leader,, and as a result were left for the worse. (It is to beleived that since being in power, Kim-Jong Un has brought the DPRK into a fast state of decline) Question 28 - Judicary and whatever follows suit, was brought underneath an 'umbrella' created by the state. The Supreme People's Assembly 'hand-pick' candidates (Something which needs to be considered - the Supreme People's Assembly consists of those 'chosen' in a elective process of sorts. Question 29 - Relating to the statement of the judicary, the fact that despite having a pseudo- judciary, citizens had little to no access to the judical system. The concepts of bribery and loyalty are brought to mind. Those loyal to the state are rewarded, whislt defectors and rebels are abandoned and persecuted. Question 30 - The state of decline and isolation the D.P.R.K was in, (as imposed by the regime) - the results affected all. Favours and preference were rampant. In order to gain favour & support, the regime rewarded those who dedicated themselves wholy to the regime (showing that those who did not were left powerless to change their situation - also they were domianted by a large majority of those who supported and to an extent endorse the regime) Question 31 - Due to the fact that i have a little more knowledge on this regime, unlike the previous country, this has been easier to answer. Question 32 - Corruption was completely ramapant and dominated North Korean society. The economy and popualtion suffered as a result of misuse of resources, and still does to this day. Those in postions of power in the regime were the main culprits of this ( accepting bribes and promises from those in high positions of power in return for loyalty etc. ) Question 33 - After watching this documentary (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEJqEuM5V68) - on the North Korean economy - this encompasses how corruption is rampant - and how the regime has had a negative influence on the popualtion in the best. The main feature her is mis-use of state/civilan resources showing how corruptive this regime is.",1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,1,4,2,6
"Jordan",1999,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Timeline chosen to as 1999 was when King Abdullah II was crowned and to this day there are pushes for Jordan to become democratic. Q21 - Jordan is not an electoral democracy. While there are elections whereby citizens vote in 120 members of the National Assembly, it cannot enact laws without the assent of the upper house - who are appointed by the King. Jordan is a constitutional monarchy and hence the King holds broad executive and judicial powers. The King must approve appointment of judges, but technically according to the constitution the legislature has independance. ('Middle East: Jordan,' accessed 22/05/2015, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html) Q22 - Jordan technically has universal suffrage as women were given the vote in 1974, hoewver 'noncitizen residents' (Jordan's approximately 600,000 permanent refugees which are overwhelmingly Palestinian) cannot vote. ('Freedom in the World: Jordan,' accesesd 22/05/2015, https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/jordan#.VV5A3bmqpBc) Q23 - being a constitutional monarchy there is obviously no multiparty competition - the ruling family passes leadership down through generations. However, the King (will consistent encouragement from the US) allegedly has intentions of helping Jordan evolve from an autocratic state to a democracy with political pluralism. A political party law was passed in 1992 with amendments made in 2012, and as of 2013 there were 30 registered parties, but as long as the monarchy still stands there is no possibility of them gaining any tangible power. ('European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity: Jordan,' accessed 22/05/2015, http://www.europeanforum.net/country/jordan) Q24 - while the Chamber of Deputies is voted for by citizens of Jordan, they have effectively no power without consent from the upper house (Senate) who are elected by the King. The King and his family hold all the power in Jordan, and without connections to the royal family regular citizens have no access to tangible political power. ('Legislative Power - The National Assembly,' accessed 22/05/2015, http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/constitution_jo.html) Q25 - most broadcast outlets are state-controlled, but satellite dishes do make foreign media available to citizens. Private newspapers and magazines exist, though government has extensive powers to close them at will. Authorities have informers in printing presses who alert them to potentially offensive material and in turn the presses are censored. Journalists are threatened with prosecution, fines and dention to encourage self-censorship. In 2008 the King issued a statement prohibiting the imprisonment of journalists for crimes of publishing; in 2013 over 200 online media outlets were blocked. Censorship of the media in Jordan is still extreme. ('Freedom of the Press: Jordan,' accessed 22/05/2015, https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/jordan#.VV5J87mqpBc) Q26&28 - as far as I can tell - an educated guess is being made here - the law is applicable to most everyone in Jordan. The judiciary is independant from the executive, though it is my guess that crimes committed within the royal family are often overlooked or brushed under the carpet. The King approves the appointment of judges and it is likely to be a family affair, as it often is with Middle Easten monarchies. Q27 - Jordan has limited freedoms of speech, association and assembly. Governmental organisations have the power to reject registration requests for NGO's, and any NGO's with political purposes are prohibited. There is limited freedom of expression, with those who violate unwritten rules with regards to reporting on the royal family or violate societal taboos face arrest. ('World Report 2013: Jordan,' accessed 22/05/2015, http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/jordan) Q29 - the constitution does not give the parliament a whole lot of power to weild with regards to checking the power of the royal family. During the suspension of parliament between 2001 and 2003, King Abdullah passed 110 temporary laws, some of which that dealth with election law were seen to actually reduce the power parliament had to question the monarchy. ('The Parliament of Jordan,' accessed 22/05/2015, http://parliamentfiles.com/parliamentary-information/the-parliament-of-jordan/) Q30 - I wouldn't quite give jordan a 2 but I also wouldn't give them a 1 - somewhere in between. While only Islam and Christianity are recognised religions in Jordan, other minorities are guaranteed the right to free worship also. 12 seats are reserved in parliament for women, Christians are reserved 9 seats and Circassian minorities are guaranteed three. I wouldn't say that these are fair representations as the lower house remains heavily imbalanced with regard to minority representation. Also honour killings and femicide are a regular occurance and are not appropriately addressed by the government alot of the time. ('The Parliament of Jordan,' accessed 22/05/2015, http://parliamentfiles.com/parliamentary-information/the-parliament-of-jordan/) Q32 - corruption is only detectable as far as I could tell within the upper levels of government, that is, within the royal family and it's connections. Q33 - as far as I can tell, the largest form of corruption in Jordan currently is that of nepotism and bribery - there have been cases of corruptopn involving high-level business and political officials with connections to the royal family.",0,2,1,0,1,2,1,2,0,2,4,1,4,7,11

"Libya",1969,2011,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Muammar Qaddafi came to power in Libya in 1969, and described as the leader of a bloodless military coup. Within 42 years in power, he invented his own system and government. His rule was characterized by patronage and the tight control of a police state. Libya's population is only six million and its oil revenues of US ($32bn) annually in 2010, but still Libyans do not feel the wealth and living in very poor conditions and it considered as one of the far poorer countries. Under Qaddafi, there was huge unemployment that estimated to be approximately 30%. Socialism did not provide free education, healthcare, subsidized housing or even transport. Also Wages were far low and the wealth from any foreign investments only benefits the elites (Kafala, 2011) . In this section I will try to focus on the corruption under Muammar Qaddafi between the periods of 1969 to 2011 and will illustrate the status of human rights and civil liberties under his authoritarian regime. Political rights and civil liberties: Political parties, universal suffrage and elections under Muammar Gaddafi: During Qaddafi 42-year rule, although the universal suffrage was existed, Muammar Gaddafi banned direct elections, calling the process of democracy 'bourgeois' and in essence anti-democratic. He is the best known as the de facto leader of Libya, ruling from 1969 till he met his death in 2011. Elections to the new General National Congress were only held in Libya on July 2012. These elections are the first elections of any kind held in Libya since 1965, Additionally, political parties in Libya were banned from 1972 until his removal in 2011. This means that Libya has not had political parties to speak since the monarchy banned it, and this shows that the situation in Libya is different from Egypt or Tunisia that both had political parties prior to their revolutions in 2011. Qaddafi introduced his own political philosophy in a book called the 'Green Book' . In this book, Qaddafi spurned political parties as form of dictatorship and he considered those who claim the right to assembly to be a betrayal of his green book. However, after his fall, a total of 130 political parties were established and started to provide people with different ideologies and political thoughts for the July 7 constituent elections. Access to political power: Libya under Gaddafi was a direct democracy in which the masses held the power. In reality, of course, all power laid in the hands of the ruler Gaddafi and his relatives of including sons, family, and thugs. No one can have access to participate in politics under his authoritarian regime. Additionally, Qaddafi warned people who want to organize politically and said that anyone who opposes his system would face repression. For example, in 1976 Gaddafi authorized the execution of 22 officers who had participated in an attempted coup the previous year, beside the execution of several civilians and rights activist. No independent Media: Under Muammar al-Gaddafi, the Libyan media system was among the most restricted in the world. He considered that mass media is a tool for revolutionary mobilization and national development. Even in the latest event and the revolution that held n 2011, the revolution was first organized using the Internet with around 500 protestors from all Libya towns. As a response, Gaddafi cut of the Internet, and blamed some channels for its coverage such as Al-Jazeera and different websites. Even more, he tried to have more control over what his people and the international world, therefore he attacked international journalist by the military, and beaten the BBC news crew by his soldiers. Media censorship was not a recent problem under Gaddafi's regime. In 1972; he also stopped all existing newspapers and linked all media stuff to all newly formed committee by people. In the 'Green Book', he illustrated that 'the press is a means of expression of society and is not a means of expression of a natural or a corporate person. Logically and democratically, the press cannot be owned by either of them. I believe that although what Gaddafi have done to largely restrict the media and have control over what is going to appear to the masses, there is a large sector of people that were willing to circumvent these boundaries (Richter) . This clearly appeared in the step that has taken by the Libyans in 2011 when they succeed to get over the limits and media censorship to end the existed authoritarian regime. Finally, after the revolution, Nouri Abu Sahmain, the General National Congress president, has confirmed that no censorship will be imposed on the media again. Corruption and the misuse of public resources (Oil) : Libya's economy mainly depends on the revenues from the petroleum sector. People can obviously see that revolts in Libya in 2011 were partly because of the corruption and the misuse of oil money by some officials. Libya produces 1.6 million barrels of oil per day and is the 17th largest producer in the world. Despite such great wealth, citizens in Libya have not seen benefits from their countries'national resources. According to Ibrahim Jadhran (2014), former commander of the Petroleum Defense Guard, the government was accused for corruption in oil illegal sale deals. People were extremely surprised to see that the Libyans living standards were very low, no clean running water, bad sewage system and they are struggling to find their basic needs. The United Nations declared that 40 per cent of Libya's populations that reached 6.4 million are living under the poverty line. This explains that no advantages from the oil reserves in Libya that are considered one of the largest country for exporting oil in Africa. Rising poverty and other problem was due to the wealth and specifically oil revenues that always channeled to the ruler Qaddafi, his family and supporters. People in Libya especially in the east were aiming not just political freedom but economic ones and need the wealth to be distributed fairly among the nation (the national world, 2011) . Rule of Law and the judiciary system: Without a doubt, the justice system in Libya under Qaddafi was completely corrupted, and there is a need to establish new fair system that pursue the course of justice and uphold the rule of law as well. The justice system was dysfunctional under Qaddafi and the detentions of approximately 8000 people that were hold by the Militias in relation to the demonstration in 2011 was an example of such corruption. Minority rights: Under Qaddafi's regime the minority groups were always marginalized and were not given the same rights as the rest of the citizens. For example, in Libya the majority of its populations are Arabs, but there are a large minority groups such as the Tuareg, Amazigh and Tebu. These groups were not treated or enjoyed the same rights as the Libyans. The Amazigh were considered to be one of the strongest opponents to the Libyan dictator 'Al-Qaddafi', and he also considered them a major threat to his own vision towards the united Arab nations (Mcbain, 2011) . On the other hand, the new government is now working on making new commitments in order to ensure that all citizens in Libya are treated equally, and the new constitutions protect the rights for all minorities. Therefore, Muammar al-Qaddafi's downfall in 2011 was a result of aggressive suppression and brutality. Under Qaddafi's regime, crimes against humanity were held and Libyans were suffering to live and achieve their basic rights and liberties for four whole decades. References: Armitage, J. (2013) .

However many point to the significant barriers faced by opposing parties to attain power. For example, Operation Lalang exemplifies the measures taken to oppose such opponents, ostensibly to prevent the occurrence of 'racial riots' in Malaysia. The operation saw the arrest of 106 persons -NGO activists, opposition politicians, intellectuals, students, artists, scientists and others-who were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act . The notion that racial riots were imminent however is contested, and it is widely believed that the operation was designed to control the political opponents of the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad through harsh measures. 'Operation Lalang -P. Ramakrishnan' . Malaysian Insider. 27 October 2009. Archived from the original on 28 October 2009. Question 22 There is little evidence as to when women's suffrage was granted in Malaysia, however it is understood that it was universal during the parameters of my chosen time period. Question 23 As stated under Question 21. Question 24. Malaysian politics operates under a framework of a federal representative democratic constitutional monarchy Question 25 'In 1987 Mahathir instituted the Internal Security Act, which permitted him to close four newspapers and order the arrests of 106 activists, religious leaders and political opponents, including Anwar Ibrahim, his former deputy prime minister. He also altered the constitution to restrictive the interpretive power of the Supreme Court, and he forced a number of high-ranking members to resign.' He also banned The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal for printing negative editorials about him, and supported a national law condemning drug smugglers to death, resulting in the execution of several Western citizens. Ultimately it is conclusive that his legacy was authoritarian in nature, and this is reflected in the heavy censorship he initiated to help secure his rule. http://www.biography.com/people/mahathir-mohamad-9395417#prime-minister Much of the material and questions above were unable to be answered in the context of Malaysia especially around the time period.

"Argentina",1989,1995,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Given Argentina in 1994 I decided to start my research from the election in 1989 that put Carlos Menem in as President after winning the election as the opposition government. That shows the competition in Argentine politics as they was a successful transition of government that occurred in that time. When Carlos Menem first came to power the next election wasn't until 1995 due to the 6 year terms but that was altered down to a 4 year term with the 1994 amendment to take place after the next election. Menem and his party won again in the 95 election. With an increasing margin of victory seen for Menem between the two elections. This could be due to the 1994 amendment which looked to make a positive change within Argentina. With a population of potential voters of 20.5 million in 89, there was a registered voter database of 20.02 million, a stat that only increased by the next election. This shows the high potential for universal suffrage but still shows a small percentage of either voters who didn't register or weren't able to register. Because I got that data from idea.int which only showed the number of voters and no explanation for why there is a difference between those numbers it left me to make an educated guess as to why that difference existed. So I couldn't give full marks for suffrage although it would be fairly close. In this period of Menem's presidency, there is an interest from the international community into civil liberties being upheld. The 1994 amendment passed into law the act of ensuring the international standard of Human Rights became supreme law. Although just because they are in law doesn't make them fully engrained into society. The religious majority enjoy their freedoms while the minorities like the Jewish community are subject to much abuse, but not government sanctioned abuse. At a social level instead. This is still a form of abuse and reduction of civil liberties within a community. One aspect that plagued the Menem government was the constant forms of corruption that appeared while at the same time trying to reduce corruption at a state and government level. Things like bribery to allow drug trafficking across borders, people being granted political and judicial immunity due to bribery and connections. This corruption was commented on by freedom house by claiming how Menem's control over the judiciary resulted in much outrage as it failed to fully enforce a separation of powers in the state. Another issue during the Menem government was the freedom of press. They were allowed within the law to act independently and freely but were often subject to intimidation and threats while trying to do their job. This included over 1000 beatings, kidnappings and torturing during Menem's presidential reign for apparently free press members. While trying to find information about 1994 was scarce in sources, I was able to gather enough evidence to be able to fill out the data entry. Freedom house does not date back to 94 but only to 98 and that was still a time with Menem as president and they ranked it as a 3 due to the civil liberties not granted to some, but overall the political freedom was followed during a seemingly good change of power in 1989 election.",3,2,3,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,3,2,11,8,19
"Hungary",1995,2000,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","I looked at the votes of the 1990, 1994 and 1998 elections using the european election database to help me gauge Hungary about the elections and voting system, and how corrupt it could be. My family is from Hungary and this was a helpful source as they have first hand encounters with the corruption, therefore my answers have a deeper understanding than that of just sources from the internet or books. Some question were contenious to answer, because they could have gone either way in 1,2 or 3 this made it difficult to decide on which would best suit the time period. The research showed that although post cold war Hungary would have leant away from communism because the party that was voted in at 1990 elections failed to bring what they had promised, the Hungarian communist party was able to gain power again and this meant that corruption would be occuring since Communist regime are infamous for being corrupt. However, the later period of the timeline also show that to this day lower-members are still corrupt. http://www.nsd.uib.no/european_election_database/country/hungary/parliamentary_elections.html",3,2,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,5,1,12,8,20

Though there is freedom of speech and expression journalists have been accused of false news and most news stations are government owned which brings into question is it only the spiel of the government that's being heard.

Though there is no full system in place it is by the people that the government is held accountable through their constitutional rights.

"Ukraine",2002,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Ukraine, up until 2012, had had a near flawless democratic system. Unfortunately, 2012 heralded an unseen turn of events: 'Ukraine's October 2012 parliamentary elections were deeply flawed, ending a string of national elections that had been considered free and fair. Former prime minister Yuliya Tymoshenko, who represented the most outspoken opposition to President Viktor Yanukovych's Party of Regions, remained in jail and was not allowed to compete. The new electoral law, revised at the end of 2011, delivered more seats to the ruling party than it would have won under the previous system. Monitors cited numerous abuses in the elections, which strengthened the position of antidemocratic factions in the parliament. ' This shows that is extremely difficult for opposition parties to even contend in elections, let alone for a change of government to happen. ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/ukraine#.VV7Wq_mqqko ) Ukraine practices universal suffrage to any citizen of 18 years of age or older. ( http://www.indexmundi.com/ukraine/suffrage.html ) As previously stated, in 2012, the leader of the opposition was imprisoned and not allowed to contend in the election. This shows that there is virtually no chance for a change of government to happen. Although political parties are allowed to be formed by citizens, there are many restrictions in place. Also, by reading the aforementioned statements in the previous questions, I can make an educated guess that there would be many significant barriers to creating one. 'Article 5. Restrictions on the Formation and Operation of Political Parties The formation and operation of political parties shall be prohibited if their programme objectives or activities are aimed at: (1) liquidating Ukrainian independence; (2) forcefully changing the constitutional order; (3) violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity; (4) undermining national security; (5) unlawfully seizing power; (6) propagandising war and violence, inciting interethnic, racial or religious animosity; (7) encroaching on human rights and freedoms; (8) encroaching on public health. Political parties shall not have paramilitary formations.' ( http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/7110 ) . Although the Ukrainian constitution enshrines freedom of speech, journalists have reported that they have been the subject of intimidation and many media outlets self-censor their work on topics that may be sensitive to the government. Freedom House evaluates Ukrainian media as 'Not Free' . : Fourteen journalists from the Ukrainian edition of Forbes magazine resigned simultaneously in November to protest censorship.' There are many issues within the Ukrainian media regarding censorship. The Ukrainian government has no recognition or respect for the Rule of Law. 'The Ukrainian government did not espouse the Rule of Law, but instead denied the public fair access to the justice system; infringed upon the integrity of the judicial branch; passed unreasonable legislation; unfairly administered laws; and removed government officials from the purview of the law.' ( https://www.bhba.org/index.php/component/content/article/250 ) . This seriously undermines the restriction, checks and balances that would otherwise characterise a democracy. Ukraine has had many issues in terms of upholding human rights. This includes the freedom of assembly and the freedom of expression. 'The government's unexpected decision to suspend signing the agreement sparked large and mostly peaceful protests in Kiev and other major cities. The protests grew after the authorities used excessive force to disperse protesters, injuring dozens, and arrested several activists for allegedly 'rioting.' The Ukrainian Government also tried to pass homophobic legislation. 'Parliament considered homophobic bills aimed at criminalizing the 'promotion' of homosexuality among children and failed to revise the labor code to include lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people as a protected category.' ( http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/ukraine ) . The Ukrainian judiciary has long been subject to scepticism from international and domestic parties. 'Global Corruption Barometer 2013 reveals that citizens perceived the judiciary to be the most corrupt public institution in Ukraine. According to Nations in Transit 2013, there has been little progress with regard to ensuring the independence of the Ukrainian judiciary& Companies generally do not trust the Ukrainian judiciary to be an effective and fair broker in business matters, according to the Investment Climate Statement 2013 .' This proves that the judiciary is inherently corrupt and that this has pernicious repercussions not only on the reputation of Ukraine's reputation but also the private citizens of Ukraine. It was hard to research this question as there was no clear evidence pointing either towards a clear checks or balances system or not. There is a judiciary, executive and legislative branch which shows that there are different organs of government. However, whether or not they are separate is another question and because of this, I can make an educated guess that there are no real checks or balances in the Ukrainian Governmental structure. (http://www.ukrainianjournal.com/index.php?w=comment&id=68) Many minority groups, such as ethnic groups, experience discrimination and do not have any legal protection 'UNPO treasurer Mr. Jeroen Zandberg also focused his speech on the situation of the Crimean Tatars, highlighting numerous human rights violations committed against them since the outbreak of the current crisis. Unjustified passport controls, the marking of doors, cases of land expropriation for 'social purposes', harassment of reporters, as well as mysterious disappearances are among the examples illustrating the unfear treatment of the Crimean Tatars.

There was other political parties allowed to run for power, and in 2008, the candiates were close - the winner had 42.3% and second was 30.6%. The media had free and open rights, without fear of consequence. The Judiciary, used to be heavily influenced by the ruling party and military during the 90's. The system was very susceptible to corruption, spreading through all public and governmental institutions. Corruption was rife throughout Paraguay, but during 2000, things were changed up, and the leaders responsible for the corruption were arrested and government was changed. Paraguay is an relatively open and free country. Competing political parties were allowed, those over the age of 18 are allowed to vote, and minorities are not segregated from universal suffrage.",2,3,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,5,2,11,9,20
"Libya",1969,2011,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","I chose to examine the period of time from 1969 to 2011 as this was the length of time the Qaddafi regime was in power in Libya. This is evidenced by 'Libya country profile -Overview'by BBC. Concerning free and fair elections, the question was difficult to answer. There were elections under this regime, but they were for 'People's Committees', a myriad of local elected representatives. Representatives of these groups made up the Municipal People's committees, representatives of these made up the Governate People's committees. However, these committees held little power compared to that exercised by Qaddafi through 'revolutionary committees'. Therefore, there were elections but they have no chance of causing a shift in power. This information came from 'Libya country profile -Overview'and 'The Cultural Revolution and People's Committees'from 'Libya: A Country Study'by Helen Chapin Metz. Any adult over 19 years old can vote in these elections. This information is from 'The Cultural Revolution and People's Committees'. In Libya there is no effective opposition -opposition parties need official approval, and as there are no elections or other mechanisms by which Qaddafi could be dethroned, there is no effective opposition at all in Libya. This information is from Freedom House 1998. Similarly to the question of free and fair elections, the ability of citizens to access political power is a difficult one, as any citizen can run for a place in the people's committees. However, there is no opportunity to run for Head of State, or any positions of real power. I questioned whether to score this a 3 or 0, and decided 0 as the political competition is not for positions of real power. This information came from 'The Cultural Revolution and People's Committees'. On the question of free media, none exists in Libya. What little exists is state controlled. This institution therefore checks the power of the regime in no way whatsoever. This information was from Freedom House 1998. Rule of Law does not exist in Libya. Qaddafi rules by decree, and his power is arbitrary. However, I could not ascertain whether other members of the government would be held accountable. The level of judicial corruption however, led me to believe that this is not the case. This information came from the 2002 Libya report by Freedom House. The judiciary in Libya was not independent for the majority of this regime's rule. The first decade, up to 1979 had a relatively independent judiciary that deteriorated after this point. Political trials are held in secret, arbitrary arrest and torture are commonplace, and security forces can hand out sentences without a trial. Courts do not make decisions contrary to the opinion of Qaddafi. This information came from Freedom House reports from 1998-2007 and 'LAW AND THE JUDICIARY'in Libya: A Country Study. In terms of checks on power, there are none to speak of in Libya. Qaddafi rules arbitrarily and without consequence. There are no official bodies to check his power. This information was found in Libya: A Country Study, as well as several Freedom House articles. Concerning the rights of minorities, Libya is dominated by Sunni Muslims of largely Arab-Berber descent. The Berber people in the South of the country are the focus of serious discrimination, with no rights to decent housing, access to higher education, no ability to open a bank account and no formal citizenship. The Tebu live in similar conditions, as do refugees in the country. This information was found in 'LIBYA OVERVIEW'by World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples. I am confident in my answers for the questions, but the issues around elections and access to power lead me to question these specific answers. Corruption is extremely pervasive in Libya, from the arbitrary power of Qaddafi at the top, down to bribery and defrauding the government at lower levels. Many different types of corruption occur on a widespread scale. This information comes from Transparency International as well as from 'Corruption undermines Libya's oil-rich economy'by Al Arabiya News. Concerning the types of corruption present in Libya, most relate to the arbitrary power of Qaddafi, and the disappearance of most of the money earned by oil exports. Even Qaddafi himself did not know where the money went, and attempted to set up anti-corruption institutions to ascertain who was stealing what. Bribes were commonplace among mid-level government officials, politically connected people were given positions of power or economic opportunities, and mass disappearance of oil revenue points to private citizens defrauding the government, if not Qaddafi taking the money himself. This information was found through 'Corruption undermines Libya's oil-rich economy'by Al Arabiya News, Transparency International and papers from The 9th International Anti-Corruption Conference by the IACC.

"Congo, the Democratic Republic of the",1998,2002,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Regime Period My reference year for Congo Kinshasa is 2001, therefore I have chosen to research the period from 1998 - 2002, which represents a period of minimal significant change. May 1997 marked the overthrow of President Mobutu's Dictatorship, which had been in existence from 1965. From 1990, Mobutu began opening his regime to democracy; in 1991 Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement joined with the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allied Civil Society to establish a High Council of the Republic to oversee a democratic transition. Laurent Kabila, who headed the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) appointed himself head of state after he overthrew Mobutu. This was seen by some to mark the 'derailing of the democratic process' - a phrase used by Francois Ngolet in his book 'Crisis in the Congo' . Consequently, the year following this (1998) marks the beginning of my period of study. Laurent was assassinated in 2001, and his son Joseph emerged as President. Another outbreak of civil war in 1998 (which ended in 2003) made it difficult to consolidate power due to the strong presence of rebel groups in the country. In June 2003, a national power-sharing government was inaugurated; there was to be one president and four vice presidents; one representative from the Rally for Congolese Democracy, one from the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo, and one from government and civil society. No significant change occurred to the political system until this point, therefore 2002 marks the end of this regime; my period of study. Political Rights Upon appointing himself head of state, Laurent Kabila promised presidential and legislative election in 1999 however this was never upheld; political parties were banned in 1997 under a law giving power to the ministry of interior to suspend parties 'in the event of violation of the law and emergency or the risk of serious public disorder' . From 1998-2002, civilians could not choose or change their government through any form of electoral process. While he did develop a transitional parliament, Kabila filled his 26-member cabinet with loyalists from his political party. By decree, the AFDL was the only political party that could engage in political activities. Despite this providing for an independent judiciary, Kabila held all executive and legislative power through the AFDL, giving him the power to appoint and dismiss members of the judiciary. The courts were highly ineffective in regard to protecting constitutional rights, which were subject to corruption and manipulation. This parliament was by no means representative, and caused no considerable political change; it just further enforced his rule. A court of military order, created in 1997 to restore military discipline increasingly delivered harsh sentences to civilians with questionable political convictions -in the first 2 years of existence, 250 people were executed through this court. A 2010 UN report on International Human rights focusing on the period between 1993 and 2005 detailed the 'lack of capacity, resources, expertise and independence of the Congolese judiciary' . Civil Liberties Freedom of speech and expression were heavily repressed. While there were approximately 30 newspapers classed as 'independent', these were not distributed beyond the country's bigger cities. In these cases, heavy self-censorship took place as Journalists were constantly harassed and arrested for producing content not to the states liking. An example of this took place in September 2002 as identified by the Freedom House Report, when two reporters were imprisoned and convicted for falsification of a public document after an article appeared that claimed the minister of public order and security had been poisoned. The newspaper printed a correction the next day and the two reporters were sentenced to 12 months in jail, clearly indicating freedom of speech was not widely respected during this time. Further to this, a report from Amnesty International in May 2001 reported the unlawful killing of thousands of unarmed civilians and torture, rape and other forms of degrading treatment conducted by government authority. Freedom of Assembly was non-existent due to an illegalisation of public demonstrations. There were no specific restrictions on the Freedom of Movement however due to the divided conflict in Congo, armed groups in the Eastern regions restricted this movement. The 2010 United Nations Mapping Report documented 600 detailed pages of the most serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law committed in Congo between 1993 and 2003. There was definitely not equal treatment in regard to the 250 minority groups present during this time. Following the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, many Hutu refugees fled to eastern Zaire where widespread ethnic killings occurred as identified in a U.N Report in June 1998. 'A Congolese Citizen' was one who has at least 1 parent that was a member of one of the tribes of Congo at time of independence. This victimized the refugees through political marginalization as they were denied full Congolese citizenship. Also, women were routinely discriminated against; they experienced fewer employment and education opportunities, even having to ask husbands permission to enter into a financial transaction. Corruption In most sources I researched, corruption was widespread, and in all forms from low level officials to elites. Although it was difficult to find examples of specific cases, an article I found in the Encyclopedia of the Nations identified corruption through taxes to be particularly widespread. The Government collected arbitrary taxes primarily from businesses. The article stated widespread claims of harassment from authorities surrounding this issue. Taxes served to enrich corrupt government officials. Research Evaluation I found deciding on a period of research for Congo Kinshasa to be very difficult. The country had been plagued by civil conflict under Mobutus dictatorship since 1965, however I thought beginning my period of study in 1965 would be simply too difficult to gather relevant data. As it happened, some changes did begin to occur, therefore I chose between 1998 and 2003 as it appears to encompass the least changes; between an oppressive dictatorship and the first democratic elections. In regard to consistency of information, I found my most of my sources to report and identify the same issues; I used a range of web pages and academic journals to ensure this. I found the Freedom House website to be very useful as a starting point for my research as it provided a broad overview concerning most issues relevant to my research, broken down year by year. The only issue I encountered with this was their research didn't extend earlier than 1998. I could not find specific information relating to question 26 and 29, however the information I had gathered on the judiciary system allowed me to make an educated guess (there was no independent check on government and the rule of law was not upheld) of which, I am very confident about. In my own words, the 'shambolic' nature of regime over my research period meant that my research fit very well with the options given; it was mostly a matter of political rights and democratic processes being non-existent.

"Romania",1990,1995,"""Not much corruption detected""","21. According to the 1993 Human Rights Report, Romania does have competitive and transparent free and fair elections. It states that: 'Most international observer groups considered that the 1992 parliamentary and presidential elections met international standards of freedom and fairness.' 22. By the 1992 election, suffrage was universal in Romania. 23. According to the 1993 Human rights Report 'opposition groups currently (1993) have 47 percent of the seats in parliament.' 25. Balkan Media ( www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13619/ ) states that: 'the relationship between the media and politics had its ups and downs: 'honey moon'feelings, harassment, economic and political pressures, 'co-habitation', aggressions and abuses on both sides.' 27. The 1993 Report mentions that 'The constitution provides for freedom of Assembly. In addition, the law on public assembly provides for the right of Romanians to assemble peacefully while unarmed and states that meetings must not interfere with other social or economic activities.' 28. The 1993 Human Rights Report notes that 'the minister of Justice relieved the president of the Bucharest municipal court, Corneliu Turianu, of his duties, allegedly politicizing the judiciary.' This is an example of how Romania attempted to keep its judiciary independent in the time period. The Report also states : 'under the terms of the 1992 law, the courts are independent of the executive branch.' 30. The 1993 Human Rights Report on Romania states that in 1993: 'In a significant move to deal with minority issues and problems, the Government established a consultative Council for National Minorities to serve as a forum for the discussion of minority issues and problems and to make recommendations to the government.' The 1992 elections were the first democratic elections in Romania following the end of the Soviet empire and the removal of the authoritarian leader Nicolae Ceausescu. Therefore by 1993 corruption in the higher echelons of Romanian politics was not prevalent since the system had only been in place four years.

"Mali",1992,2012,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Most of the information was gathered from a 2006 'Country Report on Human Rights Practices' by the US Department of State. USAID and Freedom House provided extra information when unclear. Question 21: Mali's period of democracy from its first democratic multi-party election in 1992 to a military coup in 2012 saw it become one of the most stable democracies in Africa. During this time Mali elected its first democratic leader Alpha Oumar Konaré. Mali suffered from low voter turnout for its first elections and the 1997 election was voided by constitutional court, however, outsiders downplayed this as incompetence rather than voter fraud on the part of the government. In 2002 Konaré reached the end of his presidency and was succeeded by Amadou Toumani Touré. This election was highly contested with 24 political parties in total participating. According to a report by the Carter Center the election was relatively well-run and transparent despite some irregulaties. Mali's reputation for being one of the most democratic nations in Africa continued up until 2012 when a coup d'état overthrew the democratically-elected government. A 2003 report by Freedom House stated that Mali's elections were regularly free and fair and consequently the country was given a 2.5 score (1=best, 7=worst) indicating 'free'. Question 22: Mali's constitution guaranteed its citizens universal suffrage for every man and woman over the age of eighteen years and during the specified period there was no evidence to suggest that this was not followed. Question 23: According to the US Department of State political parties in Mali generally operated free from restriction and since Mali's move to a democracy political debate is common and extensive. Freedom House stated that there were at least 75 political parties. Research from election results shows that there were regularly high levels of competition between these political parties, with no single party dominating. Question 24: In Mali all citizens had fair access to political power. In 2006 its National Assembly had fourteen members who came from historically marginalised ethnic minorities and fourteen women. Five women were members of the cabinet and a further five were on the Supreme Court. The only requirement for running as a candidate in an election was a $7000 deposit that was returned if the candidate made it over the 5% threshold. There is no evidence to suggest that there are significant legal barriers to certain citizens accessing political power. Question 25: A 1999 Freedom House report stated that Mali's media was 'among Africa's most open'. The state-run television, radio and newspapers presented a large variety of views and there were numerous independent media outlets including 40 newspapers and 60 radio and television stations that regularly criticised the government. These independent sources of media were generally free from government suppression. However there were still some concerns about overly harsh libel laws that may have cause journalists to self-censor. Question 26: The constitution of Mali upheld the rule of law and forbade the arbitrary arrest of citizens, meaning that any arrest required a judicial warrant. Further research from the US Department of State website shows that the rule of law was mostly respected in Mali and arbitrary arrests and detention were uncommon. There were no significant instances of breaches of the law by government officials and while the judiciary was not fully independent, there had been instances of anti-executive decisions and this show of autonomy was respected by the President. Question 27: Despite somewhat strict laws surrounding libel, the freedom of speech was enshrined in law and the constitution and was generally respected. However, self-censorship was common among some media who feared Islamic backlash to certain opinions or material and in 2007 two independent journalists were arrested for libel for defaming a government minister. Freedom of Assembly and Movement were generally respected, however there were instances of police using violence to quell protestors and also instances of bribe-taking during police stops of vehicles. Instances where civil liberties were not fully respected were too common for me to award the highest grade. Question 28: Mali's constitution guaranteed a judicial branch free and independent from the executive. However in practice this was not always been the case. An analysis of the Global Competitiveness Report shows that up until around 2009 Mali did not score highly in judicial independence, but I have not been able to find specific instances of regular political interference and am instead basing my judgement primarily on the aforementioned report as well as statements by Freedom House. In addition rural areas laws were enforced by local chiefs and there were often substantial waiting times before defendants could see trial. Question 29: The Supreme Court of Mali acted as the primary check on power and while there were cases where the court had gone after the administration, there were also instances of constitutional oversight as well as public corruption by government officials who were not held accountable. 'Question 30: Discrimination in Mali based on ethnicity, sex and race was prohibited under law and the constitution. However, according to the 2007 US Department of State Report domestic violence against women was common and tolerated by both the police and greater society. Spousal rape was legal and the majority of rapes went unreported to the authorities. Like many places in central Africa, female genital mutilation remained common and the country was a source of the human trafficking of women and children. An estimated 200,000 people in Mali were held in coerced servitude to a master. There is also prevalent social discrimination against members of the Taureg servile caste, the Tameshek community and other ethnic minorities. I would have marked Mali a two in this category because there is not a large amount of official government discrimination, however societal discrimination is very pervasive and minorities face many disadvantages in Mali. Question 31: I am confident in my answers for my second country. I was able to find a very useful resource in the US Department of State Report and I believe I have been able to answer each question quite comprehensively. Question 32: According to the US Department of State Report the law in Mali provided legal consequences for political corruption. Despite this, there had been numerous frequent occasions of corruption that went unpunished. This was evident in a 2007 auditor general's report where it was stated that during 2006 approximately $218 million of public funds had been lost due to a combination of economic mismanagement, corruption and fraud. Combined with this was large-scale tax evasion from fuel importation companies and also instances of fraud and financial mishandling from the departments of energy, education and health. However, top to bottom corruption was not as pervasive as in many other African nations and the judiciary had occasionally shown the willingness to prosecute cases. Question 33: The primary instances of corruption stemmed from misuse and mismanagement of public resources by government officials and occurrences of bribe-taking by police and other authorities. However, in recent years Mali began to take many steps to curb such incidences of corruption.",3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1,4,1,15,10,25
"Zimbabwe",2003,2007,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","For the following responses, I will be outlining the work that enabled me to come to the conclusions I did in regards to regime and corruption classification in Zimbabwe around 2005. I will separate the explanations to each question by an indentation in the paragraph and the number of the question that it is referring to and the subsequent point that was allocated to the country for the question. I will follow this with the resource/s used to answer each of the questions. I chose the date range of 2003-2007 for the focus of my study because it encompassed the 2005 Zimbabwean Election and allowed for studies about the reinstated governance of President Mugabe to be formed. There is a vast range of reports on corruption and other things that relate to the above questions in Zimbabwe so I felt that I had to choose one or two that I believed would be most accurate and full with information in order to form my answers. This is why I chose Transparency International as a core resource because it has no political affiliation to Zimbabwe nor any other country and carries out extensive reports yearly on the issues being discussed throughout. 4) 1 point: The ability of Zimbabwean elections to change governments is highly contested but appears to me as quite simple. Most African states such as South Africa and Namibia argue that the 2005 Zimbabwean election was both free and fair but the Commonwealth, the EU, and the United States state that they were not. Elections are not fraudulent enough to completely eliminate competition but the widespread allegations of ballot tampering and intimidation alongside the fact that President Robert Mugabe has been in power since 1987 seems to infer that the likelihood of the government changing via election is very low. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 5) 2 points: From information gathered from the CIA, Zimbabwe is said to allow universal suffrage to those over the age of 18. I think that it is unlikely for this information to be untrue but whether or not the ability to have universal suffrage matters if elections are neither free nor fair is debateable. (Reference: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/zi.html ) 6) 2 points: The two main political parties in Zimbabwe are Zanu-PF and the MDC. Zanu-PF is headed by Robert Mugabe and has been in power since independence but the MDC still contests its power. The contestation is relatively useless as Zanu-PF makes it a top priority to negate the ability of the MDC to form a strong following. The leader of the MDC has been charged twice with treason and members of the MDC are frequently the targets of political violence. I think that the size of the MDC following makes it a legitimate opponent to Zanu-PF but there is little potential for it to gain power through an election process. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 7) 2 points: The participation of women in Zimbabwean politics (through fixed quotas) and the representation of major ethnic groups points towards the ability of people to have access to political power. The core exception to this is that if the person does not follow Zanu-PF and Mugabe then they will not have the ability to stand for government as tests on loyalty to the party and leader are frequently undertaken in civil service sectors of Zimbabwe. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 8) 1 point: The Zimbabwean government controls most of the print and broadcast media. Although independent media may exist, the restrictions on it are immense and legislation is structured to criminalize the false reporting and statements that 'incite or promote public disorder or public violence.' This type of reporting is decided on by the government and books and films are heavily censored by the government. Journalists are frequently the targets of violence and prosecution often goes unheard as it is often unclear if perpetrators are governmentally affiliated or not. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 9) 1 point: I found it quite hard to answer this question and decide between if arbitrary power is wielded by a few people, the state, or both or if the leaders of the state are not subject to the rule of law. Based on the information I gathered, I think that it is more likely that the leaders of the state are not subject to the rule of law. This is through the pardoning by Mugabe of injustices that took place during the 2005 election, the failure to support property rights through the confiscation or restriction of property, and the rare investigation of torture and allegations of such which are directed towards the government. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 10) 1 point: Independent civil society organizations, labour unions and the freedom of assembly and association are technically allowed in Zimbabwean legislature but many restrictions surround them. Civil society organizations and labour unions are closely supervised and must be registered with the relevant governmental ministries to which they belong. Public gatherings of two or more people must be declared to the police and can still face aggressive action but police. This is exemplified by police response to student protests which include harassing, arresting and torturing student leaders. This clearly points towards a heavy suppression and monitoring of citizens and restricts their human rights. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 11) 0 points: The Zimbabwean constitution states that there exists an independent judiciary, where senior judges must have legal training, be experienced with Roman-Dutch law, and must be fluent in English. Under this judiciary, it is stated that every person charged with a criminal offence must be innocent until proven guilty and may receive a fair and public hearing. Although stated in the constitution, this is not followed. Government officials have publicly stated that the government has the ability to ignore court decisions that are not 'objective,' or do not go in their favour. In 2003, High Court Judge Benjamin Paradza was arrested after ruling against the government on a number of cases and it is observed that Zimbabwean's can face long-term detention without legal trial. This is clearly not an example of a free, independent or fair judiciary and regardless of constitutional agreements, these are fundamentally not upheld. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 12) 0 points: Although stated in the constitution that an auditor general will conduct audits on government operations, these are ineffective at demonstrating what actually occurs in the Zimbabwean government. The auditors who exist are appointed by Mugabe and as there is no independent parliamentary audit body then the legitimacy of the audits that exist is put into question. Public officials and ruling party leaders often evade prosecution for wrongdoing and most, if not all, government officials are not accountable to the electorate. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 13) 1 point: Regardless of the constitutional agreements and presence of women and major ethnic groups in politics, the Zimbabwean government and society does not uphold the right to equal treatment and due process for minority groups. Land seizure is a key example for the lack of this. Justifications for land seizures are made on explicitly racist grounds, on the basis that because white Zimbabweans gained the land illegally in the first place, they should be subject to the removal of it from the government. Although this is justified by the government to themselves, they are still not upholding the right to equal treatment and due process for minority groups. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 15) 0 points: With corruption defined as the private misuse of public resources, it is quite clear that corruption is widespread from the head of government to low-level government workers. High Zanu-PF officials receive seized land as gifts whilst the government is viewed to use food to buy votes during election times, not to mention undertaking many other practices to gain support. I was not able to but would like to find information regarding the direct misuse of public resources for private gain but many of such information goes unrecognized. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) 16) Special privileges granted to politically-connected people: Freedom House information shows that members of police and security forces are often fast-tracked through to official positions by Mugabe upon his approval. From this 'loyalty,'it seen that these people gain benefits such as land and properties, although it is unclear if these were obtained in lawful or unlawful manners. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) Condoning illegal business dealings: As was just mentioned, the illegal seizure of land and redistribution of such to high-up governmental officials or to those who can afford to buy it is an illegal business deal that is taken part in predominantly by the government itself. (Reference: https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2004/zimbabwe#.VV0n0fmqqko ) In addition to the points checked under this question, I think that if I were able to find relevant data proving it then 'bribe-taking by public officials'would also take place within the Zimbabwean government. The level of corruption is at a point already that condones illegal business dealings and provides certain benefits for those in power so I think that bribe-taking is something that could easily go alongside these things.",1,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,4,0,8,3,11
"Tunisia",1988,2011,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Q19. & Q20. I have chosen the time period between the years of 1988-2011, as these are the years that Zine El Abidine Ben Ali held presidency in the Republic of Tunisia. Q21. Free and fair elections were non-existent during the period of Ben Ali's rule. According to Freedom House (2004), Tunisian citizens could not change their government in a democratic manner. During the presidential elections, the ruling government did not trouble themselves with constructing the illusion of competition: the people knew there was little chance for change. Although parliamentary elections were manufactured to allow for the appearance of a multiparty legislature, Ben Ali's party held 148 of the 182 seats. Any opposing parties played a symbolic, superficial role if anything. -Tunisia -Freedom House, 2004. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2004/tunisia#.VVx4w_mqqko Q22. Universal suffrage was granted to the citizens of Tunisia in 1957. The 1959 constitution (relevant to the time of rule as no major amendments alter the laws following) states under Article 20 that any citizen is eligible to vote, provided they meet the condition of being twenty years of age, a Tunisian nation of at least five years, and fulfil conditions stipulated in the Electoral Code. The CIA World Factbook states however that various parties were inhibited from the opportunity of voting, including those of current government security force positions (police, military) ; those with mental disabilities; people who have been imprisoned for more than three months (criminal conviction only) ; and those who have attained a suspended sentence of more than six months. With these conditions oppressing the rights of what amounts to thousands of citizens, by settings which would be undemocratic in many countries subject to the modernised world, the universality and equality of suffrage rights in Tunisia is questionable. -Republic of Tunisia, Constitution of 1959. http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Tunisiaconstitution.pdf -CIA World Factbook -Tunisia. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ts.html Q23. Difficult to answer -in Ben Ali's first eleven years of leadership there was a 30 signature requirement (to be gained from members of parliament) for any citizen wanting to establish a political party or represent government; this law led to little or no political opposition. The rule meant that was there an unrealistic possibility to run against the current president, due to the mass number of seats filled by Ben Ali's own party members (holding 144 out of the available 163 seats in 1994), which therefore disabled the ability to gain signatures. After 1999 however, with the mitigating of the 30 signature law, political opposition was able to form. This was the first 'democratic' competition Ben Ali (or any Tunisian president) had faced during his reign. Regardless of this law change however, the former president retained his position of power, implausibly (and likely undemocratically) gaining 99.4% of the popular vote. -The World Today Series: Africa 2012 . Tyler J. Dickovick, 2012. Lanham, Maryland: Stryker-Post Publications -Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -Wikipedia Q24. (See political conditions in Q23) There are several barriers listed in the Tunisian Constitution which would have disabled many potential candidates from running for presidency. Article 40 states that a candidate must be exclusively of Tunisian nationality (and no other) ; must be a self-declared Muslim; and their father, mother, paternal and maternal grandparents must all be also of Tunisian nationality without discontinuity. The candidate also had to have been at least 40 years of age, and at most 75 years of age. These strict guidelines for possible government representatives restricted a great number of the multi-cultural population from having the option of standing for president. I classified this question as receiving 1 point, but as opposed to a dynastic family or a quantity of wealth, the factor of an established religion and exclusive nationality could also create an unequal/underrepresented dynamic. -Republic of Tunisia, Constitution of 1959. http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Tunisiaconstitution.pdf Q25. The mainstream and news media in Tunisia during Ben Ali's rule was mainly government controlled; the state owning all the major TV and radio networks. In the early years of Ben Ali's rule, self-censorship was expected by the media and press, but as the regime progressed, the extent of this censorship only increased to a more official degree. In the 2009 election process, the government of Ben Ali attempted to fix the results through restrictions on media coverage, repressive action taken against journalists and bloggers, and the bribery of official media to discredit critical coverage. Ben Ali's party monopolized prime-time advertising and campaigning, and independent journalists and commentators were arrested or assaulted, and their publications, broadcasts, blogs and websites were blocked. Although varying degrees of freedom in the media existed over times during Ben Ali's presidency, it was repressed heavily for important/majorities of the time. -CIA World Factbook -Tunisia. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ts.html -Freedom House -Tunisia, 2011. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2011/tunisia#.VVx4q_mqqko Q26. As defined by the World Justice Project, for a government to abide by the rule of law (among the four universal principles), the government and representatives of the state must be held accountable under the law. With this guideline for what was expected of the Tunisian president, it was difficult to find instances which were made public during Ben Ali's five term rule. An expert at avoiding any notions of a fair, democratic system, it is more than likely that Ben Ali could have conducted violations of his own laws, and let these happenings go unannounced to the public (namely through the suppression of the media) . Therefore I have answered this question by means of an educated assumption. -'What is the Rule of Law?' World Justice Project. http://worldjusticeproject.org/what-rule-law Q27. According to Article 8 of the Tunisian constitution, freedoms of opinion, expression, the press, publication, assembly, and association are guaranteed for citizens, in context of terms defined by the law . This left room for suppression of the government in many of these instances; an example of this is was the prohibition of independent organisations conveying desire for political objectivity, and the registration of independent human rights groups. The fighters for human rights of the Tunisian people were considered criminals by word of Ben Ali's government, and many were harassed, slandered, and abused. -Republic of Tunisia, Constitution of 1959. http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Tunisiaconstitution.pdf -Freedom House -Tunisia, 2011. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2011/tunisia#.VVx4q_mqqko Q28. According to the Freedom House report of 2011, the judicial system of Tunisia was (/is) dictated by the executive branch, which controlled the allocation of judges. The courts did not ensure due process in politically motivated cases, and often served those accused with harsh sentences (sometimes including internal exile after release from prison) . Trials of suspected human rights activists, and journalists were typically condemned as exceedingly unfair, and more often than not, politically biased by domestic and international observers. These indiscretions of political justice by Ben Ali's government signalled an undoubtedly corrupt/unfair judicial system. -Freedom House -Tunisia, 2011. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2011/tunisia#.VVx4q_mqqko Q29. I could find no evidence of an empirically effective ombudsman or other organisation/representative who served as a check and balance system for the Tunisian government during the authoritarian rule of Ben Ali. Given the history of corruption and unjustified policy making during the regime however, it is fair to assume that even if these institutions did exist, they would not make a significant impact on the behaviour of those in charge, or influence the amendment of unfair treatment to citizens via the government. Q30. (Religion as an example of minority group) . Due to the established religion of Islam in Tunisia, (technically speaking) those who belonged to any other religion existing in the country would instantly become minority group members. The constitution claims that the regime permits the respect for the establishment of equality among citizens, in terms of rights and duties, but this promise was not always fulfilled to the people of Tunisia. The government under Ben Ali's reign regarded the Baha'i Faith as 'a heretical sect of Islam,' and allowed its followers to practice their faith solely in the private confines of the home; strong surveillance was maintained over Islamists; on more than one occasion, the issue of passports were refused to Islamists; and efforts of Christian missionaries in converting Muslim citizens were considered a disturbance the public order, and thus were ruled illegal. There was an instance in 2006 where a report was filed over a Christian citizen was told by a security official that it was illegal to be of Christian persuasion, and were subsequently threatened with imprisonment. -Republic of Tunisia, Constitution of 1959. http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Tunisiaconstitution.pdf -International Religious Freedom Report: Tunisia, 2007. US Department of State. http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2007/90222.htm Q31. I am relatively confident of my answers due to a large catalogue of reliable information (i.e. Freedom House, international government databases), but I do signal doubt in the lasting effects of some of the points discussed, as the information over a 23 year period can vary across sources; it was also hard to summarise the reforms and judgements of regime the length of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's. Q32. & Q33. I answered this question more by the misuse of public trust and abuse of power in order recognising corrupt behaviour, but the changing of laws to rule the economy, and exploiting tax payer money (misuse of a public resource) was a standard reality for the Tunisian president between the years of 1988-2011. An example of special privileges granted to those associated with Ben Ali, was the changing of regulations to education providers, directly targeted at the competition school to his wife, Leila Ben Ali's, international education establishment in the later period of his reign. The claim that Ben Ali permitted illegal business deals was made relevant by the drug and weapon trafficking, and theft charge that he and his wife were convicted for at the end of his time in presidency, to which they were sentenced to 35 years of jail for. -'Ben Ali Family's Corrupt Grasp on Tunisian Economy Detailed in New Report.'

"Estonia",1992,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Not much corruption detected""","Q1: Are there free and fair elections for this state's executive and legislature? (3 possible points) There are free and fair elections in Estonia (BTI, 2014) . There is also a high likelihood of governance change thorough successful election of the opposition. Furthermore due to the nature of the political system executives are often empowered by coalitions which frequently change, making changes to the executive during elected terms extremely common. This is clearly shown as 13 cabinets that have held power since 1992 (Current constitution approved & first elections held), lasting an average of 1.5 years each (BTI, 2014) . There are also a large number of political parties, with the majority of the vote divided between 6 primary parties, making elections highly competitive. Therefore the requirements of 3 are easily satisfied. Q2: Does this country allow universal suffrage? (3 possible points) There is universal suffrage among citizens over the age of 18 in Estonia. However Estonia has an extremely selective citizenship policy due to its historic relationship with the USSR, excluding many remaining residents of Russian origin. In 1992 this reduced the voting population to 60% of its potential total. Increased nationalization has improved this figure to 86.5% (BTI, 2014) . Because this exclusion is based on a qualitative feature of the population, ethnicity, rather than a quantitative feature such as age this raises serious doubts as to the universal quality of suffrage in the country. However ethnic Russians are still able to vote in local elections and are therefore not excluded entirely from the political system. There are also a number of ethnic Russian politicians although an ethnic Russian party has not been represented in parliament since 2003 (BTI, 2014) . Therefore although ethnicity could be considered more than cause of a minor restriction there is sufficient suffrage for Estonia to qualify for 2 points as it is far from the widespread restrictions associated with 1 point. Q3: Is there an effective opposition and is there a possibility for it to be elected to govern? (3 possible points) Currently there are six parties represented in the Estonian government, the largest vote portion is held by the Estonian Reform Party (27.7%) with the next two parties holding 24.8% & 15.2% respectively, showing extremely effective opposition between the parties running for government. Because of the small margins between these parties it is very likely that the opposition could gain power through election. Also because of the often fluid nature of coalitions it is possible for the opposition to gain power before the next election occurs. Therefore opposition is both effective and significant with a significant chance of gaining power through non-violent elections gaining it 3 points. Q4: Do all people have full electoral rights and opportunities to participate in the electoral process? (3 possible points) As mentioned regarding question 2 members of the ethnic Russian population are often excluded form national electoral activities and rights due to a lack of citizenship. However they are able to participate in local elections due to residential status. As nationalization of this population occurs the affected population will significantly decrease, a reduction of stateless residents of Estonia by 40% has already occurred since 2002 (BTI, 2014) . Ethnic Russians are also represented to some extent by nationalized politicians who have been elected. This qualifies Estonia for a further 2 points due to a majority holding political rights. Q5: Is there are free, independent and well-resourced media that is able to act as a check and balance on power? (3 possible points) Freedom of expression is guaranteed both constitutionally and legislatively. There are 5 national TV channels, three of which are privately owned, and two of which are owned by offshore companies (Norwegian & Swedish) (BTI, 2014) . There are also multiple print and radio publications, again both publicly and privately owned (BTI, 2014) . Social media is free of constraints with Estonia having well establish technological development (the first country to introduce e-voting) . There have however been instances of passive censorship in early 2010 legislation was introduced which would allow the state to access the details of journalistic sources in limited circumstances including criminal investigations and national security. Because this increases the risk to information providers it can be viewed as a form of censorship. However the media was able to publicly protest the legislation without any form of interference (BTI, 2014) and was even involved heavily in a consultation process, although the legislation was passed regardless of their objections. Because some popular news outlets are owned by the state preferential access to information has occasionally occurred, enable the state to play a role in defining the initial angle from which an issue is viewed. These restrictions prevent Estonia from gaining the full 3 points, and could also prevent is from receiver 2, however given the distance from the requirements for a single point, 2 points appears to be the closest available result. 12.4/15 possible points for Political Rights Civil Liberties for citizens Q1: Does this regime uphold the rule of law and democratic principles? (3 possible points) In Estonia rule of law is applied across the board and there are extremely low levels of corruption recorded (BTI, 2014) . There have also been high profile cases of prosecution of both parliamentary and judiciary officials, showing that no individual is above the law. Furthermore public sector organizations have been established to act as an effective watchdog with no high level interference or pressure. Gaining it the full three points as all citizens and organizations including the governments are subject to the rule of law. Q2: Do all citizens within this regime have access to fundamental human rights, including: Freedom of Assembly and Association; Freedom of Speech and Expression; Freedom of Mobility? All citizens in the country have access to fundamental human rights which are assured in the constitution and upheld in governmental practice (BTI, 2014) . Given the countries exclusive citizenship policy there is however a significant percentage of the population which are denied the right to vote in national elections. This lack of suppression gains Estonia a further 3 points. Q3: Does this country have a free, independent and fair judiciary? The Estonian judiciary is for the most part free from political pressure and with three tiers allowing for appeals combined with a strong constitution and legislative process is regarded as fair. All people in the country are responsible to it, including non citizens. However appointments are made by the executive, and although they are for life the ability of the executive to remove the Chief justice under pretense and replace him has been publicly considered although no legislative change was passed. There have also been corruption changes made again Judges from the north-east regions where judicial practice has often come under scrutiny. However the successful prosecution of these judges illustrates a highly compliant system and thorough application of rule of law. The judiciary is in practice operated independently, although there are constitutional loopholes which have been publicly addressed, furthermore there is universal responsibility justifying a further 3 points. Q4: Does this country have effective processes in order to hold the governing regime accountable? These could be measures such as independent Ombudsman, inquiries, parliamentary question time, an upper house of parliament, select committees, etc. There are effective checks on power within the Estonian system. These include a lack of veto, even the objections of the president can be overruled by a majority vote from parliament, a constitutional review chamber of the supreme court, a legal chancellor who acts as a national ombudsman and effective publication of all legislative motions (BTI, 2014) . Neither the executive, legislative to the judiciary have over-riding power, however each is able to act as a check against actions of the other enabling a sustainable democratic system. This effective separation of powers and processes for both inquiry and investigation, meets the criteria for 3 points. Q5: Discrimination? (the right to equal treatment and due process for minority groups) The constitution expressly prevents discrimination and is fully backed by strong legislature and social safeguards. Although there is discrimination against non-nationalities ethnic Russians among citizens there are extremely high levels of equity and equality. In order to address gender equality there is even a commissioner with the power to investigate suspected cases and effectively facilitate court based resolutions of gender discrimination. There is effective representation for all minority groups and social expectation of equality which has been linked to residual communist roots (BTI, 2014) . The presence of active social and procedural discrimination prevents Estonia from getting the full 3 points, leaving it with 2. Main resources: Bennich-Björkman, L. (n.d.) . Estonian Elections.

"Mexico",1994,2001,"""Bribe-taking by public officials""","Mexico 2000 Q19) I selected 1994 because it was the first year that a relatively free election took place in Mexico since the PRI party had taken power. Q20) I selected 2001 because it was the year after PRI lost power for the first time in 71 years. Q21) In this period, it was possible for opposing parties to gain power, which became the case in 2000, but PRI still had a substantial influence on the elections due to its widespread influence. Q22) Mexico has had universal suffrage since 1953 Q23) After PRI's consistent success in the polls, the midterm elections of 1997 saw the lowest vote for a PRI candidate for the first time in the party's history, and the PRI lost power in 2000 which demonstrated an effective system that could allow opposition into power Q24) Political power is accessible to everybody Q25) The Mexican media was notoriously influenced toward PRI during their time in power, especially the Televisa channel Q26) I was unable to find information on the rule of law in Mexico during this time. Q27) Corruption in the police force resulted in arbitrary arrests, illegal searches and illegal detention. There was also widespread but not severe discrimination against women and immigrants. These factors infringed on basic human rights. Q28) The Mexican judiciary struggled with bribery and corruption - primarily political Q29) The checks and balances in Mexico had very little effect on checking the power of the PRI until reforms were put in place after they lost power in 2000. The judiciary, for example, suffered from a lack of independence from the influence of the PRI as they did not want to clash with the party on issues, even if it was at the expense of civil and political rights. Q30) Minorities, especially immigrants, suffered from discrimination socially and were not well protected from this in the legal system Q31) I am fairly confident of my answers but have doubts about some aspects of some, especially as there was a lot of political change once the PRI began to lose its grip on power. Q32) Corruption was a long term and pervasive problem among lower level government officials, with the police and security forces being two notable examples. Q33) Bribery of public officials was common during PRI's power. The government ratified an anti-bribery convention in 1997 to attempt to rectify this problem, with mixed success. I researched all of the questions and found journal articles, reports and news articles to answer the questions. I found it difficult to find information on minority rights and the rule of law. All of the answers fit well with the options given.",2,3,3,3,2,2,2,1,2,2,4,1,13,9,22
"Philippines",1987,1997,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Q. 19, 20: I chose this timespan because during this time, arguably two of the Philippines least corrupt Presidents held office. President Corazon Aquino was in office from February 25 th 1986 until June 30 th 1992. President Fidel V Ramos, who held office from June 31st 1992 until June 30th 1998, succeeded her. My time period of 1987 to 1997 most importantly contains the 1992 Philippine general election, which allowed me to convincingly answer many of the political rights and civil liberty questions. This time period could also be said to be a period of relatively 'peace' politically within the Philippines, as President Aquino's predecessor was Ferdinand Marco, a dictator who ruled under martial law until ousted by Aquino in 1986. Further, after Ramos's time in office, Joseph Estrada became the 13 th President of the Philippines in 1998, however he was expelled in 2001 through a revolt following allegations of corruption. My timespan represents a time within the Philippines where tackling corruption was one of the primary goals of both Aquino and Ramos, who both aimed to lower the levels of corruption within their country (Freedom House, 2003) . Both Aquino and Ramos introduced democratic reforms to the Philippines, such as the Presidential Commission of Good Government by Aquino, and the liberalisation of the economy from Ramos (Freedom House, 2003) . Although it is easy to establish that the goals of these governments has been to introduce democracy and stamp out the corruption which previous regimes has left, the difficult thing to answer is 'even though it is the goal of these regimes was to stamp out corruption, how much corruption was still occurring?' Q. 21: International observers called the 1987 legislative elections and the 1992 Philippine General election 'free and fair' (Moratalla, 2000) . Under Corazon, the constitution was reformed, not only emphasising more civil liberties and political rights for citizens, but also barred presidents for seeking election for more than one term. This was amended in the hopes of dismantling any barriers that stopped opposition parties gaining power (US Department of State, 2010) . However, during the 1992 election, a woman named Miriam Santiago was the front runner for most of the campaign, however, following a power outage during the counting of the votes, Fidel Ramos was named President (winning with 23% of the votes, while Santiago has 19%) . Santiago filled a protest to the Supreme Court, but it was dismissed, despite many Filipino's arguing this result. Many call this to be evidence of fraudulent elections, rigged by corrupt government employees that supported Ramos. Although this was perhaps the freest election in the country's history, even the fact that there was protesting from the public suggests that many believe the elections weren't 100% fair (Hedman) . I found this question a little tough to answer because although many state the 1992 election wasn't fair, there isn't a lot of evidence to back up these allegations. However, I made somewhat of an educated guess that since there were still levels of corruption occurring in the Philippines at this time (the transparency index score was 2.77, indicating high levels of corruption (Transparancy International, 1995) ) . The 1992 election may not have been completely fair and free, as some opposition members such as Santiago potentially faced barriers to gaining power. Q. 22: Suffrage is universal, but not compulsory, at age 18 (US Department of State, 2010) . The constitution states that 'Suffrage may be exercised by all citizens of the Philippines not otherwise disqualified by law, who are at least eighteen years of age, and who shall have resided in the Philippines for at least one year, and in the place wherein they propose to vote, for at least six months immediately preceding the election. No literacy, property, or other substantive requirement shall be imposed on the exercise of suffrage.' (The Philippines Government, 1987) . I could find no evidence to suggest any repression on voting, in particular around the 1992 election. Q. 23: Similar to question 21, in theory anyone who meets the eligibility criteria for presidency (see answer in Q. 24 below) has the ability to be elected to govern. 'The 1987 constitution mandated the attainment of full democracy for the Philippines, encompassing all the people. It also broadened people's participation in governance with a party-list system and increased the role of nongovernmental organizations. It also mandated the establishment of a multiparty political system and banned political dynasties' (Citizen Reform Agenda, 2010) . In the 1992 P residential election, there were a total of seven candidates, who all in theory had equal opportunity to gain power (US Department of State, 2010) . Although the eventual election of Fidel Ramos as President was marred with allegations of election fraud from the populist Miriam Santiago (referred to in question 21), the elections still included 'an effective opposition and a possibility for it to be elected to govern' (Hedman) . I found this question difficult to answer, as it is very similar to question 21. Although this 1992 election may have involved fraudulent behaviour, the 2 point answer of 'There is an opposition, however the system is constructed so that there is little potential for it to gain power' does not fit the events occurring within the Philippines. I would instead make a slight alternation to the 3 point question (in which I chose for the Philippines) of 'There is a significant and effective opposition with a mild likelihood of it being able to gain power through election.' Q. 24: The 1987 constitution has the following conditions that need to be met in order to be eligible to become president: 'No person may be elected President unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election' (The Philippines Government, 1987) . Everyone meeting these criteria has access to political power, although there is no guarantee they will be elected. Q. 25: Again, the 1987 constitutional amendments issued by Aquino included the right to an independent and free media (The Philippines Government, 1987) . However a 2005 'Reporters without Borders' report stated that 'at least 52 journalists have been killed because of their work since the instalment of democracy in the Philippines in 1986' (Brossel & Julliard, 2005) . 34 of these deaths occurred within my time frame (Mabuhey News) . Journalists such as Danilo Vergara, 'known for writing columns on graft and corruption was shot at close range by three unidentified assailants as he left a printing plant on Quezon Avenue in Iligan City' (Committee to Protect Journalists, 2011) . It is therefore safe to assume that even though the constitution provides a free and independent media, the press is often harassed, and sometimes killed while reporting on high profile features such as corruption. Although there is no option in the classification that actually fits this research, I chose the answer of 'No state censorship, but a degree of self-censorship may exist, or there is substantial government influence on what is reported' as it fits the events that occurred in the Philippines to a certain degree. The state didn't censor the media, but occasional events (such as suspicious deaths of corruption journalists) have led to a certain level of media repression. Q. 26: Notable and significant breaches for the rule of law under both Aquino and Ramos have occurred, although both generally attempted to uphold this law and rectify past breaches. The most significant breaches that have occurred under both leaders have been extrajudicial killings and disappearances. 'Police, soldiers, and local civilian militias are accused of committing several extrajudicial killings and disappearances and are implicated in the torture and arbitrary arrest and detention of suspects. Security forces are also accused of involvement in extortion schemes, the drug trade, illicit logging, and other illegal private activities' (Freedom House, 2003) . This is an example of certain members of Philippines society not upholding the rule of law, and were going unpunished under the regimes in power. I found this question difficult to answer, as although it was obvious that some citizens/government officials were not following the rule of law, finding example of both Aquino and Ramos directly disobeying the rule of law was hard. However, it can be surmised that since these police and local militia were not being prosecuted, therefore were not being held accountable, not only was fundamental rights being breached, the regime's were not holding government officials accountable under the rule of law. Q. 27: The 1987 constitution states the following 'No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances' (The Philippines Government, 1987) . However, similar to question 25, there have been reported instances of repression/harassment of media, signifying minor suppression. The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines also 'criminalises libel and slander by act or by deed' (The Philippines Government, 1930) . This could be seen as a breach to the freedom of speech, as 'the The United Nations Commission on Human Rights ruled that the criminalisation of libel violates freedom of expression and violates Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (a treaty amongst the UN which the Philippines is a part of) ' (Morphis, 2014) . A problem I found answering this question is that I couldn't find out when this part of the Penal Code was revised. Therefore, it could be possible that it was revised after my timespan. However, other breaches of human rights, such as minor suppressions of the media, can still justify my answer. Q. 28: The judiciary in the Philippines was stated to be independent. However, in some instances, due to understaffing and backlogging, the courts were rife with corruption (Transparancy International, 1995) . Events such as not allowing select citizens (particularly those in the poorer demographic) the right to an attorney was common practise, which frequently occurred as poorer people had little resources under the law (Freedom House, 2003) . This is also a breach of the rule of law. 'The public verdict on the judiciary is mixed. In 1985, a Bishop-Businessmen's Conference poll revealed that 30% agreed and 29% disagreed with the statement that most judges could not be bribed. In 1993, a similar split in half can be discerned. While 50% said none or few judges could be bribed or bought, 49% thought many or most could. However, one out of two Filipinos considered the degree of corruption in the judiciary serious (Moratalla, 2000) . Although this is not statistical evidence, the fact that one out of two people believed that corruption occurred in the judiciary is a sign that some level of corruption must have been happening. Q. 29: Established by Corazon in under the 1987 constitution reformations, special independent bodies were established to promote honesty, integrity and accountability amongst the governing body of the Philippines. These 'Constitutional Anti-Corruption Bodies' include; 'the Office of the Ombudsman as the people's protector and watchdog; the Civil Service Commission as the central personnel agency; the Commission on Audit as the supreme body responsible for auditing the government's expenditures and performance; and the Sandiganbayan as a special court that hears cases of graft and corruption' (Moratalla, 2000) . Both Aquino and Ramos appointed various presidential anti-corruption bodies, Aquino created the 'President's Committee on Public Ethics and Accountability' (PCPEA), and Ramos the 'Presidential Commission against Graft and Corruption' (PCAGC), both tasked to investigate corruption allegations within the President's employees (Moratalla, 2000) . The 1987 constitution adopted by Corazon herself acted as a successful check on presidential power when it limited President Ramos from running for a second term in office. Although he tried to amend the constitution in time for the election, widespread protesting on the streets from the Filipino people who opposed this measure forced him to retract these amendments, convincingly showing there are effective processes of inquiry (US Department of State, 2010) . Q. 30: As more than 90% of the Filipino population were Christians, citizens who practised other religions such as Filipino Muslims were not generally respected, and had previously lacked rights to land and lack of economic opportunities. The Christian majority has historically discriminated against minority groups like these, even though freedom of religion is constitutionally respected. However, Corazon Aquino did partake in talks with Muslim secessionists in an attempt to repair previous discrimination towards this minority group, and created an autonomous region for Muslim Mindanao's (Transparancy International, 1995) . Unfortunately, the lack of fiscal autonomy and indecisive land borders instead created more dissent amongst these minority groups and has led to insurgencies against the regimes. Both Aquino and Ramos used conciliatory and aggressive military tactics to address these insurgencies (Transparancy International, 1995) . Although it was not always the regimes themselves showing unequal treatment towards minority groups such as Muslim's, social and procedural discrimination was occurring nonetheless from the general public. Q. 31: I found the Philippines much harder to answer than Djibouti, and am therefore less confident of my answers. The reason for my uncertain is most likely because my time period starts in the 1980's, so it was hard to find credible sources for this far back in time. For example, regarding the questions 21 and 23, although there are a few newspaper articles stating corruption in the election, I had to make educated guesses on whether this was credible, or just an opponent angry because she lost. It was also hard to assert the levels of corruption occurring internally during both Aquino's and Ramos's time in office. Although it was evident that corruption still occurred, investigating whether or not the two Presidents themselves were corrupt was especially difficult. Q. 32, 33: The earliest the Philippines's corruption index score was measured by Transparency International was 1995. Luckily this falls within my time span. In 1995, the Philippines corruption score was 2.77, indicating a high level of corruption. Although both Aquino and Ramos administrations took steps to reduce opportunities for corruption since 1986, these have not been sufficient to control corruption, largely because elected officials have not shown sufficient political will to enforce anticorruption laws (Transparancy International, 1995) . Ramos's attempt to decentralise the government in the 90's perhaps led to an increase in corruption amongst lower level government officials, where legislation in 1991 transferred power to localities and regions to provide more services and increase revenue. This had adverse effects as it increased corruption, a 2001 study stating 'contractors admit to paying mayors of the towns where they have projects, because, they say, the officials can delay the work by withholding necessary permits or harassing the workers. Municipal mayors get 7% while the barangay (village) captain is given 3%. The heads of implementing agencies -usually the district, municipal or city engineer -get about 10%' (Shah, 2006) . During Aquino's time in office, a survey was taken regarding public opinion on corruption. 'As much as 58% of respondents agreed that given current conditions, corrupt government officials are a greater threat to the country than the NPA (New People's Army, communist guerrillas who lost ground after Aquino's assumption to office) ' (Moratalla, 2000) . Essentially, both Aquino and Ramos tried to rectify the corruption left in the government from Marcos's regime, but neither fully succeeded. 'The Office of the Ombudsman reported that about P9 billion was lost to government due to malversation, estafa (swindling) and violation of the provision of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for a period of eight and a half years (1990 to June 1998) . In the Ombudsman's report, 63 agencies and departments contributed to the losses. However, the top ten of these agencies alone accounted for almost P8.5 billion' (Moratalla, 2000) . Therefore, the type of corruption occurring during the time that both Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos were in office was the private misuse of public resources by government officials and public workers. Although Aquino and Ramos themselves perhaps weren't corrupt and vowed to fight corruption, it was beyond their power to harness the corruption occurring around them amongst the lower levels of government.

"Thailand",1995,1996,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Peter Lamour argues that the defintion of corruption is subjective and therefore there can be different in different cultures, in this instance it is a western standard of democracy and corruption being measured against a non-western country. In Thai politics during Banharn Silpa-Archa regime, Thailand was a constitutional monarchy, meaning that the Prime Minister (in this case Banharn) is the head of government while the monarch is the head of state (although the King of Thailand has little political power, and is largely just a symbolic position) . This also meant that the judiciary was independent. In Thailand the role of prime minister is usually held by a military person. The high turnover of parties in power shows that there is a strong chance of an opposition party being elected, and the fact that there were three different parties in succession around Banharn's period also is a good indicator of this. Banharn Silpa-Archa, of the Chart Thai party was in power from 1995 to 1996. A middle class revolt in 1992 resulted in the next two elections being democratic (including Banharn's election) . Silpa-Archa's time in power was rife with corruption, to the extent that it led to his resignation less than two years after he took office. Things like ombudsmen and enshrined political rights were not written into a constitution until 1997, after this particular regime. As it was not until 1997 that checks and balances were put in place, it is safe to assume that Bansharn's regime was lacking in these. As well as this, Thai police have a reputation today as being extremely corrupt, therefore it is safe to assume that they also were in the mid nineties, meaning that the reliability and effectiveness of the rule of law is extremely questionable. Because of these facts, it seems that the leader of the country is not subject to the rule of law, as Banharn evidently subverted the law on many occasions. Thailand has widespread suffrage and it is compulsory to vote, however, there are restrictions based on age (you can't vote if you're under 18), and also for things like mental illness, people detained for legal reasons, etc. however reliability of its electoral commission is questionable as they aren't accountable to anyone, and have large amounts of power, as they can cancel elections at any time. This didn't seem to fit in with any of the multiple choice questions, however I think it is worth noting in relation to the states corruption levels. Vote buying is also an issue in Thailand, as the election in which Silpa-Archa gained power had many reports of vote buying as the main reason that he was able to gain power (Bloomberg) . The information I gathered also doesn't quite fit in with the answers available, as while there is a high chance of a change in regime, the way in which it was voted for is somewhat unreliable. Banharn has also been accused of appointing his friends to important positions, rather than people who are actually qualified to do the job, as well as stacking his employees in his favour. As well as this, he was accused by someone within his own government of accepting millions of dollars in bribes. According to transparency international's 2014 data, Thailand has a corruption perception index score of 38/100, a good indication of the persistent corruption throughout the country. The press freedom index in 2011-2012 gives Thailand a rank of 137/179, which pretty clearly shows restrictions on the media that would likely be entrenched in society. However, he had been nicknamed 'Mr ATM' by the press due to suspicions that he had brought support of political associates. This also implies that Thailand had relatively free press, as they were able to provide semi critical commentary of their leader. These ideas conflict however, so while it is difficult to judge exactly how free Thailand press was under Banharn, an answer in the middle is a safe bet. Many minorities in Thailand lack citizenship even if they were born there, essentially making them stateless. This shows that rights for minorities aren't upheld and equal treatment is not enshrined. In the 2010's the number of stateless people in Thailand is estimated to be between half a million to a million, making it one of the countries with the highest number of these people (Katja Dombrowski) . Human rights provisions were written until the constitution was written in 1997. I found that there was a lack of accessible information on Thai politics at this time, probably due to the fact that news sites would not have 1990's Thai political articles listed, and books relating to Thai poltics were predominantly from the 1980's. Because of this, some answers ended up being educated guesses that really relied on filling in the blanks from the data that I was able to gather. I also often found that the options given for answers didn't quite line up with the information that I had, making it a bit more of a challenge to give accurate answers.

"Tunisia",1999,2009,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","I chose the period between 1999 and 2009, as these were the last ten years of non-democratic Presidential rule in Tunisia. In 2011, after a year of protests, Tunisia transitioned toward democracy with a revolution and instituted its first election -which was declared free and fair by international observers. Locating sources on which to base my answers on was not easy, possibly due to the heavily controlled nature of Tunisian press during this period, so it should be stressed that most answers required a healthy dose of educated guess alongside fact. During the period 1999-2009, corruption was widespread in Tunisian politics. The President, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, controlled the ruling party, the Democratic Constitutional Rally. Transparency International in the 2006 Corruption Perceptions Index awarded Tunisia a score of around 4/10 -not the worst, but indicating strong levels of corruption. The party won multiple elections with improbably high vote counts, indicating vote rigging, and the pretense of opposition parties was maintained, but never allowed to grow into any kind of genuine threat to Ben Ali (for this reason, Tunisia gets a '2'on Political Rights question 4 -political involvement was accessible, but power was not) . Freedom House gave Tunisia a score of 83/100 in 2006 on their Freedom of the Press scale -the press was 'not free'. One example of this is the 'harassment'and state legal action against journalist Taoufik Ben Brik, who criticized Ben Ali, which Human Rights Watch reported on in 2000. Certainly in the years between 1999-2009 journalists were restrained from openly airing their views, and for this reason there was little in the way of a free media to act as a check and balance on power. Finding information regarding the rule of law during this period proves difficult, and this lack of information helps draw its own conclusion. Rule of law was upheld in Tunisia between 1999 and 2009 -as best as it suited the ruling party (as can be seen in the aforementioned case of Taoufik Ben Brik) . I can take an educated guess and assume, from this and general corruption index scores cited earlier, that judicial independence was not guaranteed. Universal suffrage was in place during this period of Tunisian history, and respect of international human rights was improving gradually. According to womensuffrage.org, women in Tunisia have had the right to vote and stand for election since 1959. However, the first official female governor was only appointed -according to Freedom House -in 2004 (by Ben Ali) . The CIA Factbook file for Tunisia places it at 99% Muslim, and so the country has throughout its history had to deal with the restrictions that Islam imposes on women's rights. For this reason, along with the muzzling of press freedom, the question Civil Liberties 2 is answered with '2': a 2008 US Department of State report provides insight into events concerning Tunisian human rights. The implication is, as with Transparency International's 2006 rank, that Tunisia is not the worst, but was certainly not particularly flash.

"Niger",1990,2004,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Niger as a country has experienced many political problems and other issues over the past decade. There has been a series of changes in regime and governance which have led to a series of instability issues. However research specifically relating to Niger and it's issues in isolation I found hard to locate. Many of my searches seem to redirect to it's close neighbor Nigeria and therefore I found it difficult to formulate concrete answers for the questions above. Bearing this in mind as I justify my answers most of these will be subject to educated guesses resulting from some wider research into the surrounding political situation. The implementation of a constitution in 1993 meant that Niger now had what was described as a semi-presidential system. A President and Prime Minister were to be elected every 5 years in elections and a Unicameral legislature was also elected for 5 years. However in 1996 a presidential election was organized by Col. Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara during which he ran against 4 other candidates but just he dissolved the voting early and concluded himself as winner. This obviously does not constitute as free and fair. However Col. Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara was assassinated in 1999 by a military led coup and the following two presidential elections of 1999 and 2004 have been wholly concluded to be free and fair. In this way it doesn't really fit into the categories suggested by the survey for question 21, as in the first election there were opposition who had suffcient chance to run but this was taken away from them mid election. The following two elections being free and fair therefore led me to place this answer at number 2 as it cannot be said that they were completely free and fair elections but the criteria of number 2 doesn't really go as far as to cover what really happened. Question 22, it is stated on this website http://www.factrover.com/government/Niger_government.html that the 1992 constitution provided universal suffrage for all citizens over the age of 18. Question 23, The political history of Niger at this time was complicated as there was much regime change. However when the first presidential election was held although it was not concluded democratically there was opposition in the form of other candidates however they were not able to have a fair chance at obtaining power after Bare dissolved the election. Therefore this supports the proposition that there is opposition however at this time the system was constructed with little opportunity for them to gain power. Question 24 asks about access to political power. I found this exceptionally hard to find any clear cut information on for this time period, so therefore I had to make an educated guess in this instance. As the constitution was implemented in 1993 I can only assume that it contained within procedural requirements to do with gaining political office. One can only assume that seeing as suffrage was granted to be universal that the access to political power would be a similarly open pathway however this is only an assumption. For the remainder of the questions I will rely heavily on the information gained from Freedom House as this is a reputable source for documenting civil liberties and political situations. This is also one of the few sources that I was able to locate with any such information about Niger. Question 25 asks if there is a free and independent media present. The Freedom House discussion for the year 2001 (which is the primary year I was allocated) states that The National Communications Oversight Group was created in 1999 to provide independence for media and ethics. However there is a government newspaper and a number of private publications but these have loose political affiliations. They have been cases such as in 2000 when a journalist was jailed for publishing an article detailing a dispute between Niger and Benin. He was charged with 'disturbing the public order' and 'spreading false information.' This therefore supports my answer to the question as there seem to be safe guards in place to promote a free media but this is not always the case. Question 27 ponders whether citizens have freedom of speech, expression and other civil liberties. According to Freedom House in the early 1990's Niger was considered not free but moving into the 2000's it's status had increased to partly free however there is still great oppression of the citizens. Question 28, once again relying on Freedom House it states that the judiciary should be independent, however due to limited training and resources this is not always the case and they are often subjected to executive interference. This therefore supports such a low score in this area. Question 29 again is a somewhat educated guess based on the information gathered from Freedom House. For the year 2001 Freedom House states that the president is held to be 'politically unprosecutable' but should only exercise such powers in a crisis, however the fact that the President has such extreme powers hardly seems to holding the regime accountable. This also applies to my answer to Question 26 as option 1 states that the leaders are not subject to the rule of law. Question 30 asks about the treatment of minority groups in this society. Freedoms House states for the 2001 year that there is great discrimination of minority groups despite constitutional protections. People from certain groups continue to have less access to government services. It also notes a very high level of discrimination towards women. Women are given inferior rights in property, divorce and inheritance rights. Therefore it seems safe to conclude based on this evidence that discrimination of minority groups is of the highest degree. Questions 22, and 23 deal with the level of corruption in the country based on Transperancy International's Corruption Perceptions Index. Unfortunately Niger only appears on the index in the 2004 year which ranked Niger at 122 with a score of 2.2/10 which is horrifically low for a corruption perception. However this was the only year in my time period of study in which Niger appeared on the index. Therefore in the absence of this and again the distinct lack of research regarding this topic, I have been forced to make some assumptions based on what information I was able to obtain. An article from the Global Observatory states that for corruption there are no places worse than the Sahel. It states that Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world. It discusses generally that there is widespread corruption in these countries from not only the top government officials but also within minor officials and police officers. From this analysis it would be fair to conclude that the issue of corruption would have been rife at this time.

"Bangladesh",2008,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Justification for Answers I selected 2008 -2014 as the period in Bangladeshi politics to investigate, as it represents one full term of the Awami League's governance. The 2008 election was held after nearly two years of 'caretaker'governance, which in the Bangladeshi constitution was the interim government that controlled the administration between the ending of one government's term and the beginning of the next. The caretaker government was in place for so long (normally it would only be three months) due to complaints and a boycott of elections by the Awami League, against the Bangladesh National Party, which had been the government from 2001-2006. The 2008 elections represented a much called for return to electoral democracy after the caretaker government's two year tenure. Political Rights Q1: I allocate 3 points here based on the 2008 election only, and not the 2014 election (which was widely criticised) . After a two year period of prolonged caretaker governance, the caretaker government decided to schedule elections for the end of 2008, in accordance with the recommendations of international observers and the wishes of the Bangladeshi people. The general elections held on the 29 th December 2008 were widely praised, with Freedom House (2009) judging the elections to be 'relatively free and fair', a significant improvement on previous elections in the country's history, and a delegation from the National Democratic Institute describing them as 'well-administered and peaceful'(2009) . An accurate voter list, genuinely secret ballots, largely cordial relations between the major political parties and an exceptional voter turnout of 87% contributed to the good quality of the election. The Awami League came into power in the most fair and peaceful election in Bangladesh's history. Q2: Bangladesh has universal suffrage for all adults age 18 and over (CIA World Factbook) . Therefore, I award 3 points. Q3: Bangladesh has a strong two party system, with regular turnover of governance between the Bangladesh National Party and Awami League, though this turnover is almost invariably contested or temporarily boycotted at the time (BBC) . A lot of the drama associated with turnover of leadership seems to be associated with the personal vendetta between the begums of each major party, Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the BNP (The Economist, 2015), which is supposedly traced back to one woman's father being allegedly assassinated by the other woman's father back in the 1970s (Seattlepi, 2006) . With the exception of the 2006-2008 political crisis however, opposition boycotts or strikes have not led to any long term problems with turnover of administration. The 2008 elections were no exception, and the fact that the Awami League won a two thirds majority also suggests the party had a good chance of defeating the BNP from the start. On the basis of the above, I award 3 points. Q4: It is difficult to evaluate exactly who had realistic access to political power in Bangladesh in the 2008-2014 period. It is the sort of assessment that has to be inferred from other facts. Freedom House (2015) notes that 'religious minorities (i.e. non-Muslims) remain underrepresented in politics and state employment, though the secularist Awami League government has appointed several members of such groups to leadership positions.'Certainly the political status of minorities compared with the dominant Muslim group seems questionable. It is also interesting to note that both the major party leaders have occupied their roles continuously since the democratisation of Bangladesh in 1991, and both were closely associated with previous leaders of the country; Khaleda Zia was the wife of Ziaur Rahman, the military dictator who ruled Bangladesh between 1977 and 1981, and Sheikh Hasina is the oldest child of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the original founder of the Awami League. Thus, there is an association of the most powerful role in Bangladeshi politics with old political connections. In sum, I cautiously allocate 2 points here, however it is a difficult question. Q5: The Awami League's 2009-2014 government became increasingly repressive of opposition in the media, as articulated in sources such as Human Rights Watch's World Report 2014, and Freedom House's report from that year. Internet media were targeted especially aggressively, with numerous bloggers being arrested in 2013 and 2014 for criticising or questioning the government. In 2014, Reporters Without Borders ranked Bangladesh 146 out of 180 countries in its Press Freedom Index. It is with some confidence that I award only 1 point on the topic of media freedom. Civil Liberties Q6: Rule of law was poor, with a politicised and corruption prone judiciary and court system, access to which was, for the poor, quite limited (Freedom House, 2014) . Police officers regularly detained suspects arbitrarily, and many prisoners were tortured or otherwise intimidated by police. The government also cracked down on protesters at various times, outside the bounds of the law (Human Rights Watch, 2014) . The overall situation, I judge, warrants a 1 on a 3 point spectrum. Q7: As has already been made fairly clear from the above, citizens of Bangladesh had few rights guaranteed to them in the 2009-2014 period, particularly towards the end. Freedom of speech was increasingly limited as government tolerance of opposition decreased. The right to due process was almost non-existent as police undertook arbitrary detention of suspects. Homosexual activity was and is discriminated against within society, and was tacitly accepted by the government (Freedom House, 2014) . Some rights, such as the right to movement and the right to academic freedom, are relatively well upheld, however even in academia, some topics are discouraged from being researched or discussed, such as aspects of religion and politics (Freedom House, 2014) . Citizens had access to a few rights, but many were encroached upon, and so it seems appropriate to allocate 1 point here. Q8: The judiciary was far from free, fair or independent. In Bangladesh, the incumbent government makes Supreme Court appointments, the result of which is that judges have been seen to treat members of the ruling party more lightly, and a 1926 piece of legislation called the Contempt of Courts Act uses vague conceptions of 'contempt'to make much criticism of the court prosecutable (Youth Media, 2010) . The entire court system is also known to be prone to corruption (Freedom House, 2014) . I award zero points here. Q9: As the government's term drew on, it increasingly weakened mechanisms designed to act as a check on its power. The Anticorruption Commission for instance, designed to investigate corruption at all levels of the government, became increasingly ineffective due to restrictions imposed on it by the government itself (Freedom House, 2014) . An example of such a restriction came in a 2013 amendment of the law, which dictated that bringing cases against officials now required permission from the government. Naturally this removed the independence of the Commission, and made it beholden to the desires of the executive. The regime is only deserving of 1 point on the 3 point scale. Q10: Finding specific information on the topic of minority treatment in Bangladesh is difficult. It seems minorities were generally respected constitutionally, however religious minorities continued to be underrepresented in areas of governance and the state. Most active discrimination endured by religious minorities was the responsibility of Islamic groups outside of the government (Freedom House, 2014) . I tentatively award 2 points here. Corruption Q11: Bangladesh continued to be rife with corruption under the 2009-2014 Awami League government. One statistic from the Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer 2013 is especially illuminating on this front. 39% of Bangladeshi citizens interviewed reported having paid a bribe to at least one of eight services they were asked about, a very significant number. Corruption was and is found in practically all areas of the public sector, from customs, to taxation, to utilities (World Bank, 2013) . That Transparency International ranked Bangladesh 145 out of 175 countries in 2014, with a very poor corruption score of 25/100, is telling. I find it appropriate to award 1 point here. Q12: Corruption manifested itself in various ways in the Awami League administration of 2009-2014. As discussed above, bribe taking was very common among various arms of the government. Also, special privileges were granted to politically connected people in terms of how political incumbents were treated by the courts versus how non-incumbents and civilians were treated. And in terms of illegal business dealings, Business Anti-Corruption Portal (2014) wrote that 'Political leaders, who themselves are often actively involved in businesses, collude with bureaucrats in public contracting to beneficiate particular bidders at the expense of other investors, thereby creating an uneven playing field.'Basic observations like these paint a clear picture of Bangladesh's long-rampant corruption.

"Ghana",1996,1998,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Not much corruption detected"",""Other""","I choose the date of 1996 as a starting point because it was considered the year of the first 'genuine election' since the new constitution. 1998 was a goof indish date because it was prior to a lot of instituional change. Question 21 - There is an effective electoral committee that is perceived neutral and holds credible elections - however it is not completely autonomous from the government (funding etc) . There are a few elements that undermine the fairness of elections. For example: In the 1996 election there was extensive use of state media for the campaign of the reigning party however these elections were classed as 'genuine' on the world-stage. Question 22 - The 1992 constitution declares universal suffrage - 21years old and registered to. In 1998 voting turn out dropped from 78.2% in 1996 general election to 39.5% in 1998. Question 23 - There is multiparty democratic structure - with 8 parties during this period of time. 33% of the seats are opposition parties and in 1996 the President won with a 57.4% popular vote - not a landslide victory and therefore showing significant competition. However, there is significant barriers especially through use of state media. Question 24 - Under law this is correct but in practice, social discriminations would could this from happening - e.g. Opportunities for women in rural areas. Question 25 - There is an independent media and a robust private print media. However this is limited by government pressure and heavy fines against journalists. A 1964 law finds liability for anyone 'likely to injure the reputation of Ghana or its government and which he knows or has reason to believe is false' . Although this law is significantly less severe as the time it was made in the 1996-1998 period, traces of it were active. There are a lot of independent media outlets which are legal and properly licensed however there is government influence to ensure there is controlled and minimal appraisal of opposition. Question 26 - The judiciary is not independent form the head of state hence there can be no fair rule of law. (See question 28) Question 27 - Legally rights and freedoms are upheld through the 1992 constitution but how it is in practice is substantially different. Freedom of expression was tested in 1998 when journalists were jailed resulting in public protest criticising the courts for becoming 'an institution to subvert press freedom' . There is religious freedom in Ghana, with a population consisting of Christian beliefs, indigenous beliefs and many forms of Islam. Although there is tension, there are no significant restrictions by the government to strip citizens of their religious rights. There is an active Trade Union organization but they show little autonomy from the government. Question 28 - As opposed to time prior to 1992, the courts had significantly more autonomy from the government. However the judiciary is forced to enforce the rules of the government and therefore can be used as an instrument to control opposition - especially in media cases, laws have been interpreted to intimidate the media and government opposition Question 29 - Non-government organisations exist that act on behalf of the people to investigate the workings of government - e.g. human rights committees. There is said to be no political prisoners in Ghana however Amnesty finds there to be about a dozen 'prisoners of conscience' - this shows that organisations like Amnesty attempt to check the government but its effectiveness is questionable. The National Human Rights Committee are campaigning against the system which allows and forces young girls into the servitude of religious priests. These are however outside organisations - inside institutions lack autonomy with the reigning party having significant influence over all three branches of government making it impossible for checks and balances - this is seen in the legislators restrictions on the media opposing the executive, and the judiciary's (sometimes harsh) enforcement of such restrictions. Question 30 - Under the 1992 constitution, all citizens can claim statutory rights. There is a social stigma against women (especially in rural areas) and often tension between religious groups that can create unequal treatment in society. For example: One significant minority is the Konkomba who live in the north parts of the country and in the 1990s were restricted with a lack of paramount chiefs. This meant that they had trouble retaining land ownership.",2,3,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,4,2,11,9,20
"Togo",2012,2014,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","Togo has three levels of government. The president is an elected official who is in power for 5 years, the prime minister position is appointed by the president, and a National Assembly of 91 seats is elected every 5 years by the people. Togo was due to hold elections in October 2012 but these elections were delayed until July 2013 due to opposition boycotts of electoral reforms. The opposition believed the refoms were put in place to limit their chances of being elected for the National Assembly. Faure G nassingbé is the current Togolese president and head of the Union for the Republic (previously Rally of the Togolese People) . He and his father have collecitvely ruled togo for nearly half a century. This brings into question the countries ability for political change. Are elections held in Togo truly fair? Are there barriers being put in place to ensure incumbent victory? Even after boycotting the 2012 elections the opposition parties were still unable to gain victory in the following years national election. All opposition parties blamed this on election fraud being undertaken by the incumbent party though international observers have credited Togo's most recent election as being free and fair. As ws observed with Burundi, Togo's major electoral issues during this period do not seem to include a lack of sufferage or political involvement from civilians but more a unique occurence (in this case the boycotting of elections, later deemed to be fair, by opposition parties) . Yes there are policies in place that shift some electorates in favour of the ruling party, but Togo demonstartes universal sufforage and engages in fair elections so the people are truly in charge of who is to rule them at the end of the day. Freedom of press is claimed to be guaratneed by law, though some level of self-regulation is undertaken by media outlets. Attempts were made to push through a bill that would allow the National Assembly to shut down any media outlet at will, but the judiciary opposed the bill due to it's restriction of free press. This supports the idea that the judiciary within Togo is also mostly free from executive, and legislative intervention. It is the Constitutional Court that shows the most rejection of Presidential influence in Togo while other levels of the judiciary have shown signs of giving in to presidential demands and policies. Wide-spread ethinc tensions have caused a divide between the north and south of the country. The north and south have distictively different politcal views, share seperate religions, and are home to differing ethnic groups. This causes problems when political outcomes and policies favour one side over the other. The most recentpolicy supporting human rights that has been passed in Togo is one that guarantees equal representation for women in the political environment. This policy willensure that every party must have an equal number of men and women on their electoral lists. Togo currently has it's highest number of women in parliament, with 16 of the 91 seats in the National Assembly filled by women. Togo has even seen female presidential candidates running in the 2010 presidential election.",1,3,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,3,1,9,9,18
"Bangladesh",1990,2002,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people""","I chose 1990 -2002 as my timeframe because of the political unrest which occurred throughout the 1990s and only began to settle in 2002. Are there free and fair elections Throughout this time period, the Awami League attempted to force elections through use of violence and general strikes because they felt that the governing party had been elected due to electoral fraud and corruption. This undermined the ability for elections to occur because of the civil unrest it created. However, observers noted that the 1996 election was one of the fairest elections in the country's history having had a high voter turnout despite the violence and unrest. This was mainly due to a constitutional amendment meaning that elections are overseen by an independent body. The options to answer the question didn't quite suit the situation in Bangladesh because of the complex nature of the system. Universal Suffrage / Does everyone have equal access to political power? All adults of the age of 18 are able to vote. It would appear that all voters have access to political power and this is demonstrated by the fact that elections do tend to result in new governments as opposed to having one party in power for prolonged periods of time. Is there an effective opposition? Yes there is an effective opposition however it is inaccurate to say that they gained power through election. Rather they used their power and encouraged violence in order to force an election. The opposition was nonetheless brought to power in the election which they forced showing that the elections were meaningful. Moreover, the following election in 2001 the BNP were elected, showing changes in government are common. It is worth noting that due to unrest throughout the period being studied, caretaker governments were required to take over during the interim between elections which contributed to the political instability. Freedom of the Press Despite there being forms of media which may criticise the government, there is a concerning trend of violence against journalists. It is commonplace for journalists to be attacked by politically aligned attackers, or even by police. It is also common for journalists to receive death threats or have to restrict the stories they cover because they cannot travel to some areas for fear of being harmed or killed. These are among the reasons as to why Freedom House scored Bangladesh's press as 'Not Free' in 2002. Is the rule of law upheld? Women are severely let down by the justice system -they are simply not seen as equal to men under the law. For example, the procedures around reporting rapes are so strict that they actually mean that women in most cases cannot get help from the authorities. Other laws in relation to protecting women are also frequently flouted or replaced with customary Hindu or Islamic laws which are disproportionately severe upon women. It is also noted that that the poor have limited access to justice. Are fundamental rights upheld? Groups with whom citizens may associate with are heavily regulated by the government; there are virtually non-existent trade unions. Freedom of religion is not upheld, with most minority religions facing discrimination. Is the Judiciary free, fair and independent? While the judiciary is free from state pressure, it suffers severely from lower level corruption and has a huge backlog of cases meaning the accused is detained pre-trial for unfair lengths of time. Checks and Balances I struggled to find a lot of data to answer this question adequately. From what I gather, there must be independent bodies such as those which stand in as caretaker governments when unrest gets too bad and which also oversees elections (from 1996 onwards) . However the effectiveness of these measures are hard to gauge. Corruption Bangladesh was rated by Transparency International as the most corrupt country in the world in 2001. The police are seen to be the most corrupt institution in Bangladesh.",2,2,3,2,1,2,1,3,2,0,2,0,10,8,18

"Poland",1990,1995,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","Whilst Lech Walesa's rule was by no means perfect, and was constantly marred by scandal, corruption and public discontent, it did mark a substantial improvement from that of Poland's preceeding communist rulers. Media was allowed for the first time to flourish under his rule, and free and fair elections were held for the first time in decades. Whilst Poland's media suffered from substantial self-censorship and government interference (particuarly in regards to matters of foreign policy), it was largely free to critisize Walesa's power. Furthermore, Walesa's power was substantially limited by an independent legislature and judiciary. Whilst minority rights were for the most part respected, it must be noted that Poland did for the most part, lack for any significant minority groups, and as rings true accross virtually all Europe, Romani rights were for the most part ignored. Walesa's latter years were marked by increasing numbers of corruption scandals, falling numbers of allies, and failed attempts to consolidate his power. Viewed by many as having surrounded himself with figures lacking both comptetence and integrity, Walesa quickly lost the support of the public. However, it must be remembered in his defence, that when he lost re-election in 1995, this represented the first peaceful change of power in Poland since the Polish-Lithuanian commenwealth was dissolved in 1795. Therefore, Walesa, despite having a questionable record in regards to all things democratic, should be viewed as a precursor to much greater democratic rule as time went by. It is very rare that one see's a state go from outright dictatorship to outright democracy without a substantial period of transition, which Walesa's rule represented. One should now note that Poland now ranks highly in most measures of democracy, demonstrating that his rule was a success.",3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,1,13,10,23
"Singapore",1990,2004,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Other""","I choose the time period of 1990-2004 because this is when Lee Kuan Yew stood down and Gok Chok Tong took over as Prime Minister and 2004 was when Lee Hsien Loong, eldest son of former Prime Minster Lee Kuan Yew was sworn in as Prime Minister. There are elections but there is very low likelihood of government change via elections. The People's Action Party (PAP) has been in power since it was created in 1954. Constitutionally Singapore can change their government through elections and voting is compulsory. There are minor restrictions because to be eligible to vote, you have to be a citizen of Singapore, be at least 21 years old and be ordinarily resident or deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore at an address that is in that constituency. However, in practice the PAP maintains tight limits through its use of civil and security laws against political opponents, control over the press, and use of partronage. Opposition parties say that the playing field is uneven because of the governments influence over the press and its use of an array of laws to limit oppsition ideas. There is an opposition, however its numbers are muniscule and often never heard from. There is no chance for it to gain power mainly because the government requires candidates for all seats to pay a deposit of S$13,000 (US$7,123) that is forfeited if the candidate does not win a certain percentage of the vote. Parties and candidates also face restrictions on the types of materials that they can distribute during election campaigns and cannot use political films or videos. Opposition politicans are also constrained by the PAP's record of winning civil defamation suits against political foes. Only people with things such as considerable wealth have access to political power. In this case Singapore operates under nepotism. There are no checks and balances on power, but the regime sometimes investigates alleged breaches. This is because the President appoints Supreme Court judges on the recommendation of the Prime Minister with the advice of the chief justice and appoints lower court judges on the recommendation of the chief justice. Judges, especially supreme court judges, have close ties to PAP leaders. Independent media may exist but there is heavy censorship, self-censorship or government intervention in editorial processes. This is due to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act which allows authorities to restrict the circulation of any foreign publication that allegedly interferes in domestic politics. By law, the government must approve the owners of key 'management shares' in the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) . This has close ties to the PAP and owns all general circulation newspapers. Journalists practice self-censorship regarding numerous political, social, and economic issues and editorials and domestic news coverage strongly favour the PAP. The government-affiliated Singapore International Media PTE, Ltd., operates all four free television stations and at least ten of Singapore's nearly 20 radio stations. Foreign broadcasts are available. Journalists often avoid reporting on sensitive topics, including alleged government corruption or nepotism or on the supposed compliance of the judiciary. Although editorials and news coverage generally reflect government policies, newspapers increasingly are carrying letters, columns, and editorials critical of government policies. The judiciary sometimes operates independently but is susceptible to undue influence and corruption. This is apparent because the judiciary has consistently ruled in favour of the government or PAP leaders in a series of defamation suits and other cases that have nearly bankrupted some opposition figures. It is not clear whether the government pressures judges or simply appoints judges who share its values. Many judges have ties to the PAP and its leaders. However, the judiciary is efficient in criminal cases as defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and the right to confront witnesses and other due process rights. The rule of law is generally upheld, but notable and significant breaches do occur. This is apparent as police reportedly mistreat detainees at times, although the government has jailed several officers convicted of such abuses. The government also has the power to detain suspects without trial under the Internal Security Act. This allows authorities to detain suspects without charge or trial for an unlimited number of two-year periods. There is partial rights but there is still heavy suppression and monitoring in terms of freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and expression and freedom of mobility. For example, the Societies Act requires most organisations of more than ten people to be registered and restricts political activity to political parties. Authorities in 2001 reclassified two groups that had been critical of the government: the Think Centre and the Open Singapore Centre as political associations, which barred them from receiving foreign funding, among other restrictions. Authorties must approve speakers at public functions, and they occassionally deny approval to opposition politicans. The police must approve and public asssembly of more than five people. Chee Soon Juan of the opposition Social Democratic Party has served a number of jail terms in recent years for making speeches without the necessary license or on sensitive issues and refusing to pay the resulting fines. Chee was fined S$3,000 (US$1,700) for a speech in 2002. Under the constitution, Singaporeans who are fined more than S$2,000 (US$1,100) cannot contest a parliamentary election for five years. The only place where Singaporeans can make public speeches without a license is Speakers' Corner, which is located in a downtown park. There are consitutional safeguards which protect minority groups from prejudice and a fair representaion of these groups within the executive or other elected bodies. This is the case because the government has taken measures to promote racial harmony and equity with minorities well represented in government after the race riots between Malays and the majority Chinese in the 1960s which killed a lot of people. However, Malays reportedly face unofficial discrimination in employment opportunities but there are several government programs that aim to boost educational achievement among Malay students. Corruption is common, but concentrated in only some levels of the state if corruption is defined as the misuse of public resources. Corruption can take the form of special privileges granted to politically-connected people. The PAP runs an efficient, competent, and largely corruption-free government and appears to enjoy genuine popular support but as highlighted above there are certain aspects that Singapore has corruption within it's system.

"Hungary",2002,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Other""","Hungary became democratic in 1989 and although remained this way through my time period selected, Hungary has a troubled past and has had many setbacks, both economic and political. However, With in the time period selected, there were 3 elections held, 2002, 2006 and 2010. Every election since the downfall of communism within Hungary, including all three elections from 2002-2010, was free and fair where every adult was allowed to vote. ( 'Hungary Timeline ', BBC NEWS, 2012, http://news.bbc.co.uk ) In terms of effective opposition, I didn't find any information opposing the statement for 3 points: There is a significant and effective opposition with a high likelihood of it being able to gain power through election. In 2002, the Socialist Party voted into power and remained that way until the 2010 elections, this was the first time a government had been re-elected since the end of communism in 1989. Parties are free to campaign how they wish and there were no restrictions put in place for opposition parties during these elections. ('Elections to the Hungarian National Assembly ', Election Resources on the Internet, Last updated 2015, http://www.electionresources.org/ ) For question 24, on public access to political power, I gave Hungary 3 points as from research gathered I found that all adult citizens have fair access to political power. Viktor Orbán, who was voted into Prime Minister in 2010 had a fairly normal upbringing and had the desire to make a change within Hungary. ('Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary ', Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2014, http://www.britannica.com ) . Within Hungary, the constitution guarantees freedom of expression and of the press. However I gave Hungary 2 points as there were cases throughout 2002 to 2010, where there were consequences for reporters who spoke badly about the government. In 2005, a journalist was sentence to jail for slandering a Liberal Democratic parliamentarian, and later that year another journalist was given a suspended 8-month prison sentence for what he had written about the current government. ('Hungary 2005 Scores', Freedom of the Press -Freedom House, https://freedomhouse.org ) . During this time Hungary had many different printing outlets that often would criticised the government, however with these actions taken by the government towards people who publically disapproved the regime, made give Hungary 2 points rather than 3. I also gave Hungary 3 points for a free, independent and fair judiciary, as within Hungary from 2002-2010, the judiciary was free of any political influence and autonomous. Question 27 was an easy 3 points for Hungary as there is freedom of expression and speech, and the government respects citizens'rights to form associations, strike, and petition public authorities. ('Hungary -Freedom in the World ', Freedom House, 2004, https://freedomhouse.org ) . I found evidence for the allowance of parliamentary question time and select committees, and as well as this there was an independent ombudsman during this time, therefore I gave Hungary 3 points for having effective processes of inquiry and investigation within the regime. As well as this, the Hungarian Constitution, which was present from 2002-2010, provides for freedom of assembly and the government respects these rights in practice. The government also, as mentioned earlier, respects citizens'rights to form associations, strike, and petition public authorities. ('Hungary -Freedom in the World ', Freedom House, 2004, https://freedomhouse.org ) . To me, this makes me think that the civil liberties within Hungary during this time were fairly liberal, another reason for giving this state 3 points for this question. For question 30, I struggled to decide whether to give Hungary 2 or 3 points. It was hard to find the exact details on the specifics for each statement, however I decided to give Hungary 3 points because the constitution present during this time, guaranteed national and ethnic minorities the right to form-self governing bodies. The constitution also guarantees religious freedom for all religions and provides for the separation of the church and the state. This means that all religions are free to worship and preach in their own manner. ('Hungary -Freedom in the World ', Freedom House, 2004, https://freedomhouse.org ) . Corruption occurred frequently from 2002-2010 in many different forms. In 2006, there was widespread anger at tax rises and new fees for university tuition and health care. This resulted in street protests after Gyurcsany (Prime Minister from 2004-2009), admitted that his government had repeatedly lied about the state of the economy in order to be re-elected in 2006. As well as this bribery was extremely common, amongst politicians. According to 'A Diagnosis of Corruption in Hungary', written by Mihaly Fazekas in 2010, it is an open secret that parties exceed the funding limits for electoral campaigns and that this money comes from privately owned businesses that await special favours after the election. Because of this I gave Hungary 1 point because corruption occurred, however only in some levels within the state.",3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,14,15,29
"Kyrgyzstan",2005,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Kyrgyzstan regime from 2005-2010 Kyrgyzstan prior to President Kurmanbek Bakiyev rule from 2005-2010, was an authoritarian government led by President Akayev. President Akayev was eventually overthrown due to public uprisings due to the countries dissatisfaction with his corrupt and repressive regime. That July the opposition Bakiyev captured 89 percent of the Nationâ<U+0080><U+0099>s vote; election passed international standards and marked progress toward a more democratic regime. President Bakiyev made many promises that would be achieved during his term; most notably he was going to repeal the countryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s constitution where more authority would be given to the prime minister. Although President Bakiyevâ<U+0080><U+0099>s term seemed promising to his citizens and the international community, in that he was to reform Kyrgyzstanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s political system for the better, this belief was short-circuited. It became apparent as his term progressed that many of these promises were not going to be upheld as he increasingly adopted authoritarian methods. President Bakiyevâ<U+0080><U+0099>s non-democratic actions included getting rid of the main opposition leader Kulov through bribing him with a high paid occupation, as head of an energy development programme. This sort of corruption is regularly evident in society, where people of high positions obtain this through connections with the government. Furthermore, there is no independent judiciary as it is dominated by the executive. Judges are largely subject to interference from the state, mainly through bribery and this reflected through the convictions. Clearly the political system is corrupt and controlled by the dominant state. The restrictions on civil liberties have increased over time. This is firstly evident through President Bakiyevâ<U+0080><U+0099>s suppression of the media through pressure, violence and arbitrary arrests. This has been facilitated through legislation being passed to make independent journalism pretty much impossible. However, for the journalists who have reported on information unfavourable to the government, many have been suspiciously killed or threatened out of the country. And secondly, this is seen through the passing of legislation to supress minority religious groups from practicing their religion publically. In 2009 the president passed a law prohibiting religious literature in public places, moreover, the same year legislation was passed prohibiting girls from wearing headscarfâ<U+0080><U+0099>s at school. In Kyrgyzstan during the period from 2005-2001 the once widely supported president Bakiyevâ<U+0080><U+0099>s who advocated for political reform and the embracement of democratic values began to take a more hard lined authoritarian form of governance, similar to his successor. This ultimately ended in widespread public upheaval and the consequent resignation of Bakiyev as president. When examining this period, I found answering some of the questions above difficult. This is mainly due to a drastic change in regime strategy and therefore the answers differed depending on what year of Bakiyevâ<U+0080><U+0099>s precedency I was focusing on. Apart from this, the questions above did address the main concerns and issues in the Bakiyev regime. They also were cohesive with the information I found in my research and thus I was able to communicate my point effectively when assessing my selected time period.

"Guinea",2010,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Other""","I chose the time period of 2010-2015 because 2010 was the first time there were free and fair elections since Guinea's independence in 1958, and 2015 is present time. I used websites such as freedomhouse again plus news articles. News articles helped a lot in my research as finding information about Guinea was some what difficult. They gave also gave more in depth information on how things are like in Guinea, rather than just basic facts about how the country runs. Guinea had their first 'free and fair' elections in 2010, the first since their independence from France in 1958. There have been elections in the past but they were deemed unfair as there was evidence of electoral fraud. Anyone over the age of 18 can vote in Guinea and there are no restrictions to anyone. Anyone can also run for power, but because voters mostly vote for candidates or parties of the same ethnic background, power goes to the ethnic majority. There was censorship imposed on the media in guinea but a new law has since lifted it. Some journalists though practise self-censorship as there are reports that they are harassed and some even arrested if they are critical of the government. I gave an educated guess that the rule of law is generally upheld but there are some significant breaches occasionally. I did not find enough information on this but because Guinea is a recent democracy transitioned from a military government, there is a high chance that some individuals of power get away with things. A vast majority of the population have rights but there is some discrimination to minorites, such as people who identify as LGBT. There is also some religious suppression with muslims not being able to convert and non-muslims are reported to have less chance getting government jobs. An educated guess was again done suggesting that the judicial system was some what independent with some influence from politics. This is because the government is relatively young and before it was a military rule. Corruption is still a big problem in Guinea. If affects the country greatly and many government officials are reportedly corrupt, but there is action being taken to combat this problem, one of them being more press freedom.",3,3,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,1,13,10,23
"Kuwait",2006,2015,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Are there free and fair elections for this state's executive and legislature? There are free elections through which citizens may vote, however there are significant issues around the legitimacy of these elections, as is reflected in the significant boycotting movement witnessed in recent electoral campaigns, whereby only 52% of the voting populace turned out. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/02/kuwait-election-turnout-opposition-boycott Does this country allow universal suffrage? Until 2005 women in Kuwait were not awarded suffrage. However, this right was re-established, and now the existing voting population is only restricted by age in that citizens under 21 are not deemed eligible to vote. http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/kuwaiti-women-struggle-suffrage-blue-revolution-2002-2005 Is there an effective opposition and is there a possibility for it to be elected to govern? There is sufficient opposition to the existing government, however institutional restraints greatly reduce other parties propensity to be elected into governance. Kuwait technically holds a ban on political parties, however its political system is generally acknowledged as the most democratic in the Gulf region thanks to its elected parliament which has legislative powers. Many members of opposition parties have been arrested or detained for their political perspectives and it is ultimately unlikely that a contesting party will be elected into governance. http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/political-parties-are-banned-in-kuwait-1.1121896 http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/13/us-kuwait-politics-idUSBREA3C0HR20140413 Do all people have effective access to political power? There is some bias in which citizens may attain political power, for example; candidates from the ruling, non-Bedouin hadari class hold more political power than the Bedouin tribal population. In addition to this, migrants are seldom given political powers, given many arrive from South-East Asia to work lower income jobs and thus are prone to political discrimination. These and other similar discriminant factors have created significant populist protest in recent times with the aim i=of creating reform. A nation of bureaucrats: political participation and economic diversification in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates . International Journal of Middle East Studies 41.03 (2009) : 375-395. - Michael Herb Print Media Liberalization and Electoral Coverage Bias in Kuwait - Kjetil Selvik, Jon Nordenson, Tewodros Aragie Kebede The Middle East Journal Volume 69, Number 2, Spring 2015 pp. 255-276 Is there a free, independent and well-resourced media that is able to act as a check and balance on power? Kuwait's media is restrained by self-censorship, intimidation, and government pressure. Freedoms of speech and the press are protected by the constitution, but only 'in accordance with the conditions and in the circumstances defined by law.' It forbids criticism of the emir, the disclosure of secret or private information, and calling for the overthrow of the regime, which in turn has significant impacts on the media's ability to either check or balance the power of the ruling regime. Political assassinations and removals of high-profile media targets who advocate against the regime have been relatively common, which negatively influences the supposedly free media. http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/aug/11/press-freedom-kuwait https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2012/kuwait#.VV6yXfmqqko Does this regime uphold the rule of law? To some extent there is an existing rule of law in Kuwait. However this is often bent or shaped so as to favour the ruling powers, and the legal system is often utilised as a method of restraining any form of opposition to the government. In addition to this, the Emir, though selected by legislature, holds significant power which can be exerted over the other branches of governance. http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/amnesty-condemns-jail-sentence-upheld-kuwait-opposition-mp-1588181674 Do all citizens within this regime have access to fundamental human rights, including: Freedom of Assembly and Association; Freedom of Speech and Expression; Freedom of Mobility? Kuwait continues to exclude thousands of stateless people from full citizenship, despite their longstanding roots in Kuwaiti territory. The government has aggressively cracked down on free speech, often resorting to a law forbidding any offense to the ruler. A new effort to dramatically reduce the number of migrant workers in Kuwait has led to the implementation of regulations to allow for swift and unlawful deportation. According to local activists and lawyers, government forces responded with excessive violence to multiple demonstrations by Bidun and Kuwaiti citizens. The year 2013 saw increased violations of free speech in Kuwait. https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/kuwait?page=2https://www.hrw.org/middle-eastn-africa/kuwait Does this country have a free, independent and fair judiciary? Despite the formal independence of the judiciary, sources report that the judiciary is not independent in practice. For instance, the Bertelsmann Foundation states that the judiciary often makes decisions in accordance with the official political view. Correspondingly, Freedom House 2013 reports that the Emir of Kuwait is responsible for the appointment of judges and the executive branch monitors the promotion of judges. Furthermore, the Heritage Foundation 2013 also reports both that the judiciary lacks independence and that the judicial branches are widely perceived to be affected by corruption and political interference. http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/kuwait/corruption-levels/judicial-system.aspx Does this country have effective processes in order to hold the governing regime accountable? Few formal methods of accountability exist in the Kuwaiti governing bodies, though the legislature does possess the ability to dismiss an Emir if they become unfit to rule, this seldom happens. Likewise the Emir then has the ability to select and dismiss members of the judiciary and executive, meaning the separate branches are severely interlinked. Does this country uphold the right to equal treatment and due process for minority groups? There are some rights guaranteed to minorities, however, many, such as the displaced stateless citizens the 'Bidun' or migrant workers are often subject to significant rights abuses on behalf of the government. As such, it is evident that the Kuwaiti government's treatment of minorities is to be held at a relatively low standard. How corrupt was this state during the period of study? Extensive corruption among Kuwait's high-level government officials is a problem resulting in political tensions between the government and the public. Kuwait has one of the largest oil reserves in the world, and its economy is mainly based on export revenues of petroleum, which comprises 80% of the government's income. Kuwait has demonstrated an increasing openness to foreign investment and has passed several reforms to attract international companies. However, the extensive corruption among Kuwait's high-level government officials affects the political landscape of the country and results in political tensions between the government and the public. Kuwait's bureaucracy is often inefficient and non-transparent, and it can be biased in favour of domestic companies. Nevertheless, Kuwait still faces challenges in curbing corruption. Challenges include the following: Kuwait's bureaucracy is often inefficient and non-transparent, and it can be biased in favour of domestic companies. While Kuwait's public procurement process is cumbersome and susceptible to corruption - and many investigations and trials involving government officials accused of wrongdoing in the procurement process are ongoing - no one has been convicted for bribery since the end of the Gulf War. http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/kuwait/snapshot.aspx",1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,6,7,13

"Zimbabwe",2000,2006,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","'Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president since independence from Britain in 1980, has abandoned the rule of law and resorted to outright dictatorship. His government faces mounting opposition from all layers of society due to rapidly deteriorating economic and social conditions, the failure to distribute land and the war in the Congo.' This was stated in an article in February 1999 a year before the elections in Zimbabwe, this article helped me come to my conclusion on a lot of the questions stated above. I also read a lot about the state having a large influence on the media within Zimbabwe especially around the period of elections and continuing on for a couple of years after. When the opposition returned to the polls in 2000, they won 57 seats, only five fewer than ZANU . Zimbabwe currently has for a long period of time abused human rights and freedom of speech making it easy to answer quite a lot of the questions regarding state freedom etc, ever since Robert Mugabe began ruling Zimbabwe the rule of law was completely abandoned therefore making the country's political system fairly corrupt. It was difficult to also answer the ethnic groups and cultural groups question because Zimbabwe's society and culture is very corrupt, especially towards white people and the farmers. Over all though my answers to the questions are as accurate as they can be, even though some questions can be difficult to work out culturally.

"Turkmenistan",2008,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","In Central Asia in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union liberalisation has been slow, and nowhere has it been slower than in Turkmenistan. It remains one of the poorest, most isolated, and most static of the former-Soviet republics. For 21 years, one man ruled Turkmenistan with an iron fist, Saparmurat Niyazov. He erected a personality cult, maintaining a police state that led to a stability through fear. Societal limitations and an isolationist policy meant that the nation remains one of the most extreme examples of an authoritarian state, the old political habits of the USSRstill firmly in place. Niyazov was quick to declare, upon Turkmenistan's independence, that 'we don't need formal democracy.' [1] The election of Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov in 2007 raised questions as to whether Turkmenistan would be raised out of the political doldrums enforced by Niyazov. [2] A symbol of the Soviet Era, a Turkmenistan without Niyazov was difficult to picture. Berdimuhamedov promised major reforms, but in most regards Turkmenistan has remained as repressive and insular as it has ever been. The changes have been largely cosmetic. Berdimuhamedov continues to maintain one of the most repressive dictatorships on Earth. The time period I have selected is significant in that it begins with the adoption of Turkmenistan's new constitution which promised major political overhaul. These reforms, as with many of the so-called reforms introduced by Berdimuhamedov, are easily overstated. Once again, they exist predominantly for the purposes of rhetoric and international appearances. That said, they do impact the data insofar as one can no longer say that Turkmenistan is strictly a one-party state. In 1991 the independence of Turkmenistan changed very little. The Communist Party of Turkmenistan's name was changed to the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan, but the people stayed the same. [3] In 2008, elections were held with more than one candidate for the first time. That said, all of the candidates were selected from within the ruling Democratic Party, and Berdimuhamedov had already been appointed acting-President on the death of Niyazov. In addition, very little information was given regarding the different candidates. [4] In elections held in February of 2012 Berdimuhamedov was re-elected after receiving 97% of the vote. [5] Protests, rallies, demonstrations, and political meetings all but fully prohibited in Turkmenistan. [6] Whilst the new constitution in 2008 allowed the restricted existence of parties other than the Democratic Party, Berdimuhamedov made it clear that no other party would ever rule Turkmenistan. [7] Most opposition groups are in exile. There are many reports of government agents bribing and pressuring citizens to head to the ballot boxes. [8] It seems apparent to most that the elections are a sham. Even so, official figures show vast turnouts, in line with the Soviet tradition of displaying electoral unanimity. The executive, legislature, and judiciary have no clear separation. The constitution makes the proclamation of the existence of a separation of powers, yet there is none, largely due to the absolute dominance of the Democratic Party and the active role of the President within each branch. [9] Judges are appointed on five-year terms by the President. There is no judicial review of executive action. [10] In his second inaugural speech Berdimuhamedov swore to be 'the guarantor of the rights of all the citizens of the Turkmen state.' [11] The Turkmenistan Constitution promises such fundamental freedoms as freedom of expression and freedom of movement. [12] No such freedoms exist unfettered in Turkmenistan. All citizens are legally bound to carry domestic passports on their person at all times, and must show them if requested by an official to do so. Human Rights Watch has described Turkmenistan as 'one of the most repressive and authoritarian states in the world.' [13] This notion is echoed by most NGOs. Freedom House gives Turkmenistan the worst score of seven for both infringements of political rights and civil liberties as of 2014. [14] Reporters without Borders'World Press Freedom Index 2014 places Turkmenistan as third worst in the world for its treatment of journalists and media organisations. [15] Some progress has been made since the death of Niyazov, most obviously the establishment of public internet access and a broader education system. [16] However, even with these changes the Committee to Protect Journalists still dubbed Turkmenistan as one of the top ten worst countries to be a blogger. [17] Women too face extensive discrimination, largely based in socio-religious norms. [18] Just a cursory examination of the Turkmen political scene illustrates widespread and institutional corruption. Berdimuhamedov has continued Niyazov's tradition of consistently creating pretext for rotating government officials to avoid the risk of any rivals to his power establishing themselves. [19] Furthermore, entire ministries have proven to be engaged in extremely corrupt behaviours. The Interior Minister Orazgeldy Amanmuradov was dismissed after it was discovered that he had been accepting bribes to garner to release of particular prisoners. [20] It was also discovered that many Ministry of Interior staff were involved in drug-dealing and bribery. Amanmuradov was transferred to the head of a new police academy. Beyond this corruption at high levels of governance, it is also pervasive amongst authorities and officials of a more day-to-day status. Tom Mayne of GlobalWitness states that to do anything in Turkmenistan 'one needs to grease a palm', to the point where bribes are normal parts of everyday life. [21] Furthermore, in much the same way that the Democratic Party simply spawned from the Communist Party, the KGB were renamed the Committee on National Security, accountable solely to Berdimuhamedov. [22] They remain a looming presence within Turkmen society, stamping out opposition on the rare occasion that it arises.

"Albania",1991,1997,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Question 21: Unsure, couldn't fine much information about the way Albania deal in Executive and Legislature, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Albania - was the only source of current information stating that there are elections, but there is also light corruption in the way these matters are handled. Question 22: http://womenshistory.about.com/od/suffrage/a/intl_timeline.htm - tells us that women were granted the vote in in 1920. There are no major parts in the voting system, BUT, there are some restrictions outlined 'http://www.euroblind.org/convention/article-29--participation-in-political-and-public-life/nr/2088' - where amendments were made in the mid-90's in the hay-day of Albania's corruption, embezzlement and other such activities, that opposition parties were momentarily suppressed by the current government. Question 23: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_Albania - shows us that just like int he US there are essentially only 2 parties: Socialist and Democratic. Both function relitively the same and are elected between each other with no other independent, or 'other' party seen since the early 1910's. Parties also seem to fluctuate support for example in 1996 - there was a small election rig or coup and the newly elected Socialist president held power for only ~3-6 hours before being ousted and a Democrat put back to carry on the policies of the last government. Democrats ruled Albania majority through the 90s with little opposition ruling from essentially 1991 - 1997, them being ousted in another coup. Question 24 and 25: (Neil Olsen, Albania, 200, Oxfam GB publishing) - discusses that Albanian citizen are very poor and have little wealth to divide amongst the generally large families. To this, there are not many rich Albanians, especially considering they are one of Europe's worst GDP per capita countries. The power is essentially 'reserved' for the wealthy, but anyone can join a political party if they wish, it's just that if many did, they would go no where in a political career. As each party charges steep rates in joining, maintaining membership and sponsorship costs and such, that those in the higher levels of the political sphere are the oligarchs and business men of Albania. In terms of its media this only gave a brief outline that 'foreign media have painted a constantly negative picture of Albania' - especially since the 1997 coup (discussed later) - but the Albanian government itself, inclusive of the media 'reflects this simplistic struggle for political power [all of the press, TV and radio are state owned] which makes it difficult for people to make informed and unbiased decisions' telling us that the Media in the country is heavily censored and run by the government broadcasting only what they want. They talk about how during the reign of the Socialist Party and Basha (in the 90s), there was little media control in private hands and little political power in the hands of citizen. Question 26: (Neil Olsen, Albania, 200, Oxfam GB publishing) - again tells of of Law in Albania, telling us that people are generally not aware of the law giving us an example of ' [recently was passed in 1995] a law which gives women the right to say whether or not a case goes to court... women are unaware of this change' - there is a veil of ignorance (blanket of ignorance, if you will) put onto the population of Albania to refrain them from contributing to the law as a whole. It talks about how in the 90s there was also mass arrests of protesters opposing the current government and somewhat government mis-care in civil matters. This all leads me to believe that Rule of Law under the Albanian regime was null-existent. Question 27: I couldn't fine any research for this part of the question, but I assume since it somewhat ties to the last 3 questions, that the same logic can be applied behind it. So that is why I put 1 as if there was no political power given to people. There would obviously be no civil power given either. Question 28 and 29: these questions ring the same basis and I found that ( http :// www . everyculture .com/A-Bo/Albania. html ) - told us that ' here has been a substantial degree of taking the law into one's own hands. However, this is not a new phenomenon but part of Albanian tradition. For centuries, it was not the central government but Albanian customary or traditional law that governed social behavior and almost every facet of life in northern Albania.' - that there was no judicial system and that mostly people went about daily lives in a constant grind, it seems. ' This customary law is widely respected today. In its definitive form, the Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini had chapters covering church; the family; marriage; house, livestock, and property; work; transfer of property; the spoken word; honor; damages; crimes; judicial law; and exemptions and exceptions. ' - there was also a clear lack of judicial law in the country in the period of the 90s. this is exemplified through the coup (' Christopher Jarvis, Rise and fall of Albania's pyramid schemes, March 2000. ' ) - caused by the governments many crimes against the people and fraudulant practices in trade destroying many lives Question 30: http://www.minorityrights.org/1400/albania/greeks.html - told us that in the 90s the largest majority of minorities was Greek and these Greeks had their religious supressed, by having their churches (Orthodox Christian) closed by the Muslim government. A pa rty was set up for the saving of minority rights in Albania but followed with ' 1991, OMONIA was banned since it violated Law 7501 (1991) which forbade 'formation of parties on a religious, ethnic and regional basis'. On behalf of OMONIA, the Unity Party for Human Rights contested the 1992 ' - there were no parties dedicated or laws dedicated to minrity rights, especially religious rights. Question 32: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Rebellion_of_1997) and (http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/arag/document-listings/special/S42/view?searchterm=%20%20Albania%201997-1998) during the time period I was studying the regime in commanding control of Albania was threatened because it's dirty dealings had become public and had finally toppled as the economy of Albania crashed destroying many lives of many people.",2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,0,8,5,13
"Nigeria",1985,1993,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Q. 18, 19 & 20 Around the administered year of 1990, I have used the years 1985 and 1993 as inclusive boundary points to limit my period of analysis. These dates coincide with General Ibrahim Babangida's ascension to the presidency through means of a coup d'etat, and his eventual relinquishment of power. This extended era of study affords a proper examination of the totality of the Nigerian regime apparent in 1990. Q. 21 Babangida presided over a regime established through a bloodless coup in 1985, and existed as part of a series of intermittent military juntas spanning three decades; from 1966 to 1998. The latter years of Babangida's rule were characterised by a restricted - and largely ineffective - attempt to establish democratic practice. Presidential and National Assembly elections were absent during the examined period until 1992/93, when what appeared to be free and fair elections were enacted (African Elections Database, 2011) . However, as a US Department of State human rights practice review addresses, the processes involved leading up to the 1993 presidential election were suspect - Babangida's regime manipulated the proceedings extensively, actively excluding various prospective candidates and significantly damaging the election's credibility as a result. Also, before the National Electoral Commission was able to formally announce the results, a restraining order was issued by the high court - impeding this process (US Department of State, 1994) . Following this, General Babangida annuled the election entirely, tenuously citing election fraud. Therefore, the elections were clearly arbitrary and had little to no chance of truly changing the regime. However, they existed nonetheless and thus aligns with the 'There are elections for the legislature and executive but there is very little likelihood of government change via elections' condition aptly. Q. 22 Suffrage was relatively straightforward during the study period - universal over the age of eighteen (CIA, 2015) . Universality was achieved in the 1977 Electoral Decree, which amended the 1962 Electoral Act, granting women in northern Nigeria suffrage (Azinge, 1994) . Q. 23 The question of effective opposition and respective electoral potential proved a complex issue to rate in this circumstance, as the electoral situation was rather unusual. Due to the fact that the first six years of General Babangida's rule lacked any formal electoral challenge, the only realistic potential for regime change came in the form of attempted coups - of which one very nearly succeeded in 1990. The Nigerian constitution affords citizens rights of political organisation (including party formation), however only two political parties were officially sanctioned for the 1993 election - of which both were created by the Babangida regime (US Department of State, 1994) . By annuling the results of the election and reneging on his promise to step down following the election of president as the result of democratic process, Babangida exemplified the fact that the political power in Nigeria rested solely with the incumbent regime, the public vote and constitution being essentially powerless. Despite it being their constitutional right, the regime's ensuing tyranny evidenced the fact that the parties were only able to form because Babangida allowed them. Thus, they were merely nominal opposition. The extent of their political power was at the mercy of the incumbent president, rather than the opinion of the people. In this circumstance, the provided rating scale is somewhat incongruous as whilst the opposition was significant (theoretically, 100% of the voting public as Babangida did not run himself) it realistically had no chance of changing the regime as power was too centralised. The fact that both parties were Babangida creations, yet he annuled the results anyway, suggests he never intended for a winner to be announced. However, we cannot be entirely certain there was absolutely no chance the regime could have been changed democratically by the opposition, and thus the most fitting condition is 'There is an opposition, however the system is constructed so that there is little potential for it to gain power.' Q. 24 As previously discussed, despite their constitutional rights, the votes of Nigerian citizens carried little political power. Elections act as the primary conduit for the public to exact their share of the political power - hence if such an institution is a veritable farce then little ability to influence political machinations remains with the majority of the populace. The oil economy is a source of great conflict between the citizenry and leaders in Nigeria. The availability of the resource itself is limited to to areas in which the local ethnic groups have minimal control of or access to political power (Ikporukpo, 1996) . In an exploitative regime such as this, then, it would be economically counter-intuitive to decentralise power and allow significant public access to political determination - as otherwise they risk the decentralisation of their assets also. Therefore, it is predictable that access to political power resides almost exclusively within the military regime itself - with the majority belonging to Babangida himself. 'The majority of people do not have any access to political power; power is concentrated within an elite few.' Q. 25 The ability of media to act with freedom and agency under Genera Babangida's regime reflected a simple power dynamic to that suffered by the general Nigerian populace. Critical editors were rarely tolerated, and thus self-censorship was rife as a result. One such editor was Dele Giwa, the editor-in-chief of 'Newswatch' - a weekly news magazine. In 1996 - whilst investigating drug connections to the Babangida's wife - he was apprehended, interrogated, and eventually murdered with a letter bomb (Oputa Panel, 2005) . In a Nigerian Human Rights Violations Investigation Commision (HRVIC) report, it was concluded that significant incriminting evidence implies the involvement of President Babangida his military delegates in the murder (HRVIC, 2002) . Therefore, in the earlier years of Babangida's regime it was institutional repression that proved the greatest barrier to press freedom, however in later years moves were made by the regime in attempt to officialise legal state censorship. Most notably, media houses deemed critical towards Babangida's actions regarding the annuled 1993 Presidential Election were closed, and a series of press freedom-restricting decrees were enacted (US Department of State, 1994) . Therefore, we can conclued that while 'Independent media exist [s], there is heavy censorship, self-censorship or government intervention in editorial processes.' Q. 26 Political academic Claude Ake notes that ' Nigeria democratizes with no separation of power, with all powers having been rested on an imperial Presidency. There is hardly any rule of law, and no plausible system of justice or transparency.' The President is therefore unchallengable in his political power, and thus has no obligation to uphold the rule of law other than to appease the constitution. The Oputa Panel also cites a lack of governmental accountability, in that 'The Chairman of the Commission intervened and referred to section 5 of the Tribunal of Enquiry Act and reminded Counsel that the Commission had the power to summon anybody in Nigeria to attend its sittings and give evidence. However, counsel for General Ibrahim Babangida noted that the section referred to by the Chairman was 'subject to just exemptions' . Therefore, by manipulating the law, and amassing unchallengable power, Babangida is able to act in a tyrannical fashion. Rather than being a subject of the law, the law is a subject of Babangida. The Dele Giwa murder is an expemlification of this fact. 'Arbitrary power is wielded by few people, the state, or both.' Q. 27 The discussion of Dele Giwa's murder also pertains to another important aspect of regime classification; the preservation of fundamental human rights amongst citizens. The treatment of Dele Giwa in no way reflected proper judicial process, and prompted governmental officials to evade human rights panel investigations - heavily suggesting guilt and improper process in the matter. This would represent a major exemplification of human rights abuses in Nigeria, as not only would Giwa - and by extension, the entire Nigerian citizenry - have been denied rights to freedom of speech (by silencing a critic) but also rights to a fair trial if he were deemed criminal. Elsewhere, the US Department of State observed further extra-judicial killings; police brutality; and various infringements on freedom of speech, travel, organisation and affiliation (US Department of State, 1994) . Babangida's Minister of Justice, Bola Ajibola, attempted to justify the repression - stating; 'If we accept that a military rule is an abberation, then we should be prepared to logically assume that it cannot satisfy the condition of regular government in terms of human rights.' Ajibola's statement reveals the systematic, institutional nature of the human rights abuses at the time, as the leadership argued it was not their priority nor a concern. The abuse was active, however. Constitutional rights promised citizens to organise themselves in special interest interest groups without government approval, however the regime denied this right in 1993 when public demonstrations were banned for fear of pro-democratic violent protest. Also, the 1979 and 1989 constitutions promised freedom of mobility, yet Ken Saro-Wiwa's passport was seized as he attempted to travel to Vienna to attend a human rights convention. This act damned the regime's human rights record twofold - firstly by denying constitutional rights, and secondly by attempting to avoid bringing attention to their inadequacies by absenteeing themselves of representation in Vienna - a clear concession of guilt. Therefore, it is clear that while 'partial rights exist, there is still heavy suppression and monitoring.' Unfortunately, there was no option specified that while rights may be promised constitutionally, the regime completely controlled whether these rights were available to individual citizens. Constitutionally, most human rights exist yet few are truly avaiable to citizens. Q. 28 As discussed in question 26, the state clearly has significant power of influence over the judiciary - significantly damaging its integrity. As exemplified by the Giwa case, government tyranny lacks culpability in Babangida's Nigeria. The constitution designates separation of powers and independence of the three arms of government, however as we have seen the regime has little regard for abiding the constitution. In practice, the separation was mostly theoretical. As Yahaya Abdulkarim posits in their examination of Judicial Corruption in Nigeria, the absence of effective power separation between the executive and judiciary 'often results in the former exerting undue influence over the latter.' This is supported by the Oputa Panel's revelation that a witness in the Dele Giwa case had their sentence commuted from fifteen years down to five years, by General Babangida (HRVIC 2002) . The fact that the president was also able to demand a high court restraint of the announcement of the results of a licit election also contributes to the conclusion that the Babangida administration had undue power over the Nigerian judiciary, diminishing its integrity and voiding its process of the ability to be free and fair. Therefore, the lowest rating on the scale is applicable. Q. 29 During the regime, organisations to which the freedom of Babangida's power was obligated were few and far between. An typical ombudsman existed - known as the Public Complaints Commission - however, as political academic Dr. Victor Ayeni (2006) contends, it developed into an 'inefficient bureaucracy'. He argues that the close relationship the commission tended with the civil service nullified its independence and eliminated its defining features as an ombudsman institution. Furthermore, its poor accessability and promotion - the majority of the population were not communicated its existence (Hossain, 2000) - further exacerbated its inability to exact its crucial functions of checking and balancing regime power. Within the government itself, there were no effective mechanisms of power mediation. Therefore, we can conclude that there institutions which intend to check and balance power, yet they are ineffective. This finding aligns with the 'somewhere in between' condition. Q. 30 There is no constitutional repression of minority groups in Nigeria, however certain groups experienced active political discrimination during the Babangida regime. According to the previously referenced US Department of State report, several political organisations were banned by the regime - its justification being that the organisations in question were established under tribal, ethnic and religious ideology for sole purpose of supporting certain political candidates. Also, it was noted that women were the subject of discrimination due to the government condoning various damaging customary and religious practices. Therefore, whilst constitutionally protected, minorites still experienced effective methods of discrimination and repression, in which the regime was implicated. This aligns aptly with the 'There are legal and statutory rights, but there is active social and procedural discrimination towards groups and minorities.' Q. 31 I feel significantly assured in my classifications, as not only have I exacted extensive research from a broad range of reputable sources, I have also minimised the number of assumptions made to ensure my contentions are based fully in historical fact. However, I hesitate from marking myself as being absolutely confident, as I understand that there is always the potential for certain important information to be lost or skewed over time. There is always the potential for error. Q. 32 & 33 Nigeria is regularly referred to as one of the most corrupted countries in world. During Babangida's regime, this corruption was manifested in 3 main areas: bribery, political privileges and misuse of public resources. I did not find significant evidence to comment on the condoning of illegal busines dealings - it very likely did happen, however one cannot be sure or make such bold assumptions. The most egregious example of governmental misuse of public assets is in the oil economy. Much of Nigeria's oil is produced in a region inhabited by the indigenous Ogoni minority, and as the US Department of State report finds, 'the government seizes Ogoni property without fair compensation, ignores the environmental impact of oil production on Ogoni land, and fails to provide adequate social services, such as water and electricity.' This injustice is then supported in Agbiboa and Maiangwa's study of corruption in the Niger Delta, who find that '80% of Nigeria's oil and natural gas revenues accrue to one percent of the population.' The regime clearly prioritises the centralisation of resource profits above the development of a fair state economy. The citizenry has no access to agency over their public resources. In terms of judicial bribery, a UNODC study in 2007 recorded that 79% of respondent business owners paid bribes to the court system - constituting the largest bribes paid to any sector, at an average $87 USD per transaction (Abdulkarim, 2012) . Police bribes were also frequently cited, with a 58% report. Corruption is therefore pervasive at many governmental levels, from lower level civil servants to high ranking officials. Also, as seen in the Dele Giwa case, those with high authority are granted extra-legal powers of privelige, such as Babangida's overriding of high court sentencing to reduce a convicted's prison term. Nigeria is an extremely corrupted country, and, most likely, no matter the specified conditions, Nigeria under Babangida would consistently score at the greatest extreme of corruption measures.

Other parties run for seats in parliament, however most of these are puppet parties used to give the appearance of democracy. They all follow the Ba'ath regime policies. Therefore despite elections being held they could never result in a regime change, and are tampered with if necessary. (US Department of State) Political Rights 2, there is universal suffrage in Syria, after women were granted the vote in 1949 Political Rights 3, opposition is allowed in Syria, however they follow Ba'ath policies and the parties are never allowed to get larger than a few hundred members. No one can run against Assad for the presidency and voting results are tampered with, so there is no hope of a change in government. Political Rights 4, in order to gain powe, one must be a member of the ruling Ba'ath party, which is made up of those from the Alawite minority in Syria. The presidency is hereditary, with Assad grooming his younger son to take power, unless you are member of this family or community, you have no avenues to power. (Freedom House) Political Right 5, the regime controls the entire media, and satellites are illegal. 88 foreign journalists have been killed in Syria since 1992 (CPJ) and it was named the world's most dangerous place for journalists. (Vanity Fair) Civil Rights 1, rule of law in Syria is difficult to find information on prior to the recent civil conflict. However based off evidence of Assad's ability to do whatever he likes, as well stories of many laws being upheld prior to the conflict such as crackdowns on punishing homosexuals (Pink News) I have made the judgement that law is upheld but that those in power are above it. Civil Rights 2, Human Right Watch details how people in Syria 'disappear'without a trace, human rights to women, homosexuals, ethnic groups and other minorities are denied, as well as artibitrary arrest, torture and violence. There is also no freedom of speech as media is controlled and freedom of movement is restricted. (Human Rights Watch) Civil Rights 3, both the legislative council and the judiciary are voted for by the people, but only Ba'ath members can be elected. There are elections, but essentially they make no impact on how the judiciary will work. (Human Rights Watch) Civil Rights 4, There is no checks or balances on Assad's power, or the power of the Ba'ath regime. All of the power lies in the Alawite sect, and no one can oppose the ruling party. (US Dep. Of State) Civil Right 5, There are no rights for ethnic minorities in Syria, and many actually have legislation legalising their discrimination, women have some legal rights, but these are often not upheld. (Human Rights Watch) Corruption, corruption is rampant in Syria, with the dissolution of democracy, the Syrian government uses corruption to ensure loyalty. Bribery is not against the law in the private sector, and due to general disregard for rule of law corruption throughout the police and other public sector areas is huge.

"Jordan",1989,1994,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Jordan Justification 18-20. In 1989 mass riots broke out over the current economic crisis and government corruption in Jordan. King Hussein decided to reduce dissent by initiating some liberalization and democratization processes. These limited reforms were undertaken with the aim of preserving the monarchical regime. I choose to research between 1989 and 1994 because these were the years with the most significant outwardly democratic reform. In years following 1995, repression became more prevalent and freedom decreased in Jordan. 21. I have given Jordan one point, because the Jordan in 1989 and 1993 did result in changes of composition of the legislature and cabinet. During the 1989 election political parties were illegal, but significant opposition became possible with legalisation in 1992 (Andrew Reynolds and Jorgen Elkit, Jordan: Electoral System Design in the Arab World, International IDEA, http://www.idea.int/esd/upload/jordan.pdf ) . The 1993 Election adopted a new 'one man, one vote' single transferable vote policy that made it more difficult for opposition in the Muslim Brotherhood to get substantial representation (Reynolds and Elkit) . It was impossible for elections to have a meaningful consequence on the ultimate exercise of executive power by the king. King Hussein held the governing prerogatives to appoint or dismiss the prime minister and cabinet from the house and had the ability to call elections when he saw fit (Freedom House Jordan 2012, https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2012/jordan#.VV7VVPmqqko ) . 22. Jordan receives two points, because at this time Jordan had suffrage for all people over the age of 19 (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Arab Political Systems: Baseline Information and Reforms- Jordan, Washington: 2008 http://carnegieendowment.org/files/Jordan_APS.doc ) . 23. Jordan receives one point. In the Jordanian context this question crosses over with question 21; as discussed above, in 1989 there was no effective opposition, though some did emerge with the legalisation of political parties in 1992. There is no chance for opposition to gain the ultimate power which resides with the king. The control over elections and cabinet resided with the king. The opposition to monarchists in the legislature and executive is small and its numbers were decreased by the use of Single Non-Transferable Vote system (Reynolds and Ekit) . 24. Jordan has received zero points, despite the legalisation of political parties, people remained politically disempowered. Both elections saw less than half the population turning out due to their distrust of the state and the similarity between candidates policy platforms (Katherine Rath 'The Process of Democratisation in Jordan' Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.30 no.3: 1994, pp.530-557. http://www.jstor.org/stable/4283656 p.544) . Women were especially politically disempowered with only 70% female literacy in contrast to 89% male literacy (New Internationalist issue 252: 1994, http://newint.org/features/1994/02/05/profile/ ) . Although women were 50% of the voters, they made up only 2% of the candidates in the 1989 election (Katherine Rath, p.545) . Rath describes a social contract in Jordan where people were given some economic freedom in exchange for giving ultimate power to the State, this contract debilitated peoples political rights (p.538) . 25. I have given Jordan one point, as some independent but censored media seems to exist. Published information on Jordan's media in the early 1990's is scarce, but the Jordanian National Charter of 1991 guaranteed 'freedom of thought and expression' through the media at the same time as asserting that media 'must have a formative role in shaping citizen attitudes of commitment to their county' and 'preserving social harmony,' presumably this prevents media criticism of the institution of monarchy ( Jordanian National Charter of 1991 retrieved from RefWorld, http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b53b4.html ) . Some estimated guesses were involved in answering this question, I have been influenced by Freedom House's first report on Freedom in Jordan, released in 1998, which indicates severe censorship of the press with regulations in 1997 ( https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/1998/jordan#.VV6vNvmqqko ) . 26. Jordan receives one point because the leaders of the state are not subject to the rule of law. Without a formal separation of powers between the institutions of political power or a fully independent judiciary, the rule of law is not maintained. In Jordan the Monarch and is not accountable, and the executive dominates over legislature and judiciary (Sufian Obeidat, Rule of Law Quick Scan Jordan, HiiL:2012 http://www.hiil.org/data/sitemanagement /media/QuickScan_Jordan_191212_GK.pdf p.7) . 27. Jordan receives one point, because despite the appearance of human rights on paper in the 1991 National Charter, they lacked reinforcement from the State and were often breached. However, after 1992 it became legal to assemble political parties. Physical violence against civilians was not widespread and the Cigranelli-Richard Human Rights Data Set gave Jordan a positive high score of 6 out of 8 for the physical integrity rights in 1994, where low scores indicate grave human rights abuses (CRI in Obeidat, Rule of Law, p.45) . 28. As described above, the judiciary was not fully independent and was dominated by the executive. To answer this question I drew on some information covering a slightly later period. In 1998, Freedom House indicated that the judiciary was not 'independent in sensitive cases' which I think demonstrated when nine cases of high-level corruption were dismissed by the courts in 1990 (Nigel Ashton, King Hussein of Jordan: a Political Life, USA: Yale University Press, 2008. p.255) . This led me to give Jordan one point. 29. Jordan receives 0 points, as seen above, there is no effective process to check the executive. 30. This question does not fit within a Jordanian context, as minority groups were advantaged in Jordan. King Hussein and the royals are of Hashemite ethnicity which is a smaller portion of the population than the Palestinian majority and held greater power due to their cultural heritage (Muldar Zahran 'Jordan is Palestine' Middle East Quarterly Winter 2012, pp.3-12 http://www.meforum.org/3121/jordan-is-palestinian ) . The smaller Bedouin also has been granted special privileges (Muldar Zahran Is Jordan's King Losing Control over the Bedouin 2011 http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/2209/jordan-bedouin ) . I have nominated one point for this question, because the majority has been disadvantaged through the discriminatory advantages given to minority ethnic groups. 31. I am very confident with my answers in this section, nominating 5.4 because I did have to get support from some sources dealing with 1998 and later years to ascertain some aspects of Jordan's political landscape between 1989 and 1994. 32/33. It is hard to determine how exactly how much corruption there was in the 1989-1994 period, but corruption was certainly common. At this point in time, Transparency International was only begging to establish quality research and investigation, but the first paper they produced featuring Jordan in 1996 gave them a Corruption Perceptions Index score of 4.89 between the years 1993 and 1996 based on the perceptions of business people ( https://www.transparency.org/files/content/tool/1996_CPI_EN.pdf ) . This score indicated visible levels of corruption that had significantly increased in the last decade, and would continue to do so post 1994. During the 1989 riots there were allegations of corruption against the current Prime Minister Zaid al-Rifai that in part led to King Hussein accepting his resignation (New York Times, 'Jordan Plans to Lift Martial Law,' Amman:1989 http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/20/world/jordan-plans-to-lift-martial-law.html. ) Nigel Ashton indicates that there was likely some significant high level corruption regarding 'siphoning-off of state funds' from powerful people ( King Hussein p.155) . Reports of bribery in Jordan today are very common, but there is no comprehensive study of low level bribery in the early 90's, however there undoubtedly was some minor low level corruption. The nine high level cases that were dismissed from court in 1990, included major allegations such as the selling of national gold (Ashton, p.155) . It is unfortunate these cases were not fully investigated, but the fact that the allegations exist suggests a degree of corruption among officials. Some estimation was required in answering these questions of corruption in Jordan, but the evidence suggests that significant corruption existed in the higher slopes of power in Jordan between 1989 and 1994. The above forms of corruption demonstrate some special privelages granted to politically-connected people, like the monarchy and royal Hashemite family, some misuse of public resources by top officials and suggest a degree of bribe-taking by officials.",1,2,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,4,1,5,3,8
"Romania",2005,2012,"""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","As well as the information given through the Transparency index the evaluation of Romania in 2008 gives an outline of the governments views and the type of behaviour that was happening: http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119100.htm This source was incredibly useful as an overview of the country and influenced my answers quite heavily. The report is worth looking at as it goes into more detail regarding the following questions. POLITICAL RIGHTS: 'Political Rights 1: Are there free and fair elections for this state's executive and legislature?' 'Political Rights 2: Does this country allow universal suffrage?' 'Political Rights 3: Is there an effective opposition and is there a possibility for it to be elected to govern?' I decided to group these answers as from my research established that Romania allowed all of these factors as they are relatively unrestrictive on the political rights of the individuals/political groups in society. However it is noted in the report that the way in which seats are presented in the elections is far to complicated for the general voter to understand and therefore makes it hard to know whether the person that has a seat really earned it. 'Political Rights 4: Do all people have effective access to political power?' From the reports everyone has access to political power and effectively anyone can be involved regardless of gender, ethnicity etc. 'Political Rights 5: Is there a free, independent and well-resourced media that is able to act as a check and balance on power?' The media is is widely free from government intervention however, there is still laws in place that meant that government slander was against the law and punishable. So although the media has free reign over what it puts out into the public it cannot slander the government. CIVIL LIBERTIES: 'Civil Liberties 1: Does this regime uphold the rule of law?' The regime aims to uphold the law in society however some laws are less followed up than others which means that there is some mistrust in the government's ability to uphold the law especially regarding the corruption in the police and officials. Corruption was one of the main issues that stemmed from the upholding of law. However, the government were trying to change this just not overly effectively. The government does aim to uphold law but can be said to be not that effective as seen through the corruption in officials, which causes public distrust. 'Civil Liberties 2: Do all citizens within this regime have access to fundamental human rights, including: Freedom of Assembly and Association; Freedom of Speech and Expression; Freedom of Mobility?' The government does not interfere with any of these civil liberties and as a result all citizens have access to these fundamental human rights. The only issue that came from my research was that there was subtle interference, nothing major but slight tweaking of these liberties that meant that there was some governmental influence. However, there was not enough interference to take away the civil liberties and they remained relatively untouched. 'Civil Liberties 3: Does this country have a free, independent and fair judiciary?' 'Civil Liberties 4: Does this country have effective processes in order to hold the governing regime accountable? These could be measures such as independent Ombudsman, inquiries, parliamentary question time, an upper house of parliament, select committees, etc. These processes must have some real effectiveness, not just exist on paper.' These questions were educated guesses as in order to be able to be in the European Union there are multiple checks and balances that would be required as a result of gaining entry as policies would of had to be shifted and changed to align with the EU's views. Government interference in terms of restrictions on the above questions would result in the government being far more corrupt and particularly see the government be more involved in the civil and political rights mentioned in these questions. 'Civil Liberties 5: Does this country uphold the right to equal treatment and due process for minority groups?' The civil liberties in Romania are generally really good and the report highlights all of this, there are very little restrictions and the country aims to encourage the equal rights of all citizens. CONCLUSION: Romania has Anti-corruption hot lines, as corruption in Romania remains a huge problem and it is established that in 2008 the public had a loss of respect for the police due to the levels of corruption and the lack of consequences from the government. The management of corruption is poor however; it is more among lower society individuals not the collective government. Romania is far less corrupt than that of Belarus and I found that this section was easier/harder to write about as there were some aspects of flaws in the government but they were trying to change this. The corruption issue in officials is more that the government has an ineffective way of dealing with it and that needs to change, but the civil liberties and political rights remain relatively untouched making it a much freer society.",3,2,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,3,4,2,13,13,26
"Haiti",2001,2006,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings"",""Other""","Regime Period: I chose 2000-2006 to demarcate the regime period even though it doesn't represent one continuous presidential term because those years mark the event of elections. 2000 is one election year, but the then President, Aristide, was ousted into exile in 2004 and between 2004-2006 an interim government presided. 2006 is another election year where a government was actually elected, ending the interim period. Note: The 'Approach'and 'Definitions'section of the system apply to Haiti as they did for Chad. Thus I will not repeat the same sections. Sources All sources used in this research project are as credible as possible. The information attained from them is regime-period specific. Most sources dealt with evaluative and critical reports and information supplemented by technical/formal processes information. One subject in particular that was difficult to source information about was political power citizens had effective access to; very little information on citizens'avenues for power could be found. Freedom House 'places a greater emphasis on whether these rights are implemented in practice' . They were a baseline for further independent research (as far as possible) with the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (I.D.E.A.), Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Inter-Parliamentary Union, United States Library of Congress, Reporters Without Borders, and World Bank. Challenges: There weren't too many challenges with Haiti, though some areas were harder to obtain information on than others. In particular, political recourse for citizens and specific information on government accountability was difficult to find. Classification Summary Haiti rated 7/30 points placing it well within the non-democratic category. The perpetual political and civil instability, natural distasters, lack of state resource in which to build infrastructures and rebuild severely weakened ones, and corruption all undermine any democratic process or efforts made. freedom House rated Haiti consistently for political rights, civil liberties and overall freedom as a 6 in 2002 (with 7 being the worst) . Haiti then dropped by half a point to 6.5 for overall freedom and down to 7 for political rights in 2006. Though Haiti is a republic, the lack of consistency in government and the inability for parties and presidents to stay in power leaves Haiti leaderless and directionless in the face of pervasive corruption, civil unrest and discontent, a badly damaging and deteriorated infrastructure, and severely underresourced civil servants and institutions. None of the institutions like judiciary, media, or elections are effective; combined with outdated laws, rampant violence, human rights abuses, and discriminatory practices. POLITICAL RIGHTS Question 1 Haiti has a bicameral National Assembly ( Assemblée Nationale ) consisting of the Senate ( Sénat ) and the Chamber of Deputies ( Chambre des Députés ) . The president is elected for a five-year term (consecutive terms are forbidden, although one can hold the office a second time after a five-year hiatus) . Deputies are elected for a four-year term and senators for a six-year term. One third of Senate seats are up for election every two years [1] . Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected president with 91.5% of the vote in 2000. There were 4,000,000 voters registered, 2,871,124 who voted. In 2004, President Aristide was ousted and Boniface Alexandre became president in an interim government. René Préval one the 2006 presidential elections where there was a 55% turnout, with 3,533,430 registered to vote, 2,093,947 who actually voted [2] . There are some technical provisions that even the playing field. There is public funding available upon procurement of 40,000 citizens signatures. This money is earmarked for campaign spending and political education. There are also provisions for free/subsidized access to media for candidates [3] . All elections have been organized by a provisional electoral authority -Conseil Electoral Provisoire (CEP) -composed of nine board members: one appointed by the private sector; three by the Catholic, Episcopal and Lutheran churches; one by human rights organizations; one by the Supreme Court; and three by political parties [4] . Although nominally independent, the CEP is routinely subjected to political manipulation by the party in power [5] . The 2000 elections were marred by alleged irregularities, low voter turnout, and opposition boycotts. Both domestic and international observers noted irregularities in the tabulation of election results for some Senate seats. The Haitian government refused to address the earlier contested election results, so the United States and other international donors withheld election assistance and refused to send observers, and opposition parties boycotted them. Although Aristide won the election with a reported 91.5% of the vote, turnout was very low, with estimates ranging from 5% to 20% of eligible voters participating. Other controversial aspects of the elections included that, of 2.2 million votes cast, about 8% of the ballots were missing, many believed to have been stolen or destroyed; and 8% were nullified because they were illegible [6] . The 2006 elections were held in the presence of over 9 000 United Nations personnel including some 7 000 troops and 1 700 police officers. They were monitored by more than 200 international observers. The discovery of voting bags and marked ballots in a garbage dump triggered a series of street protests by Mr. Préval's supporters. The United Nations Mission in Haiti spoke of an 'apparent grave breach of the electoral process'. More here and here . Conclusion: Citizens of Haiti cannot change their government democratically, evident by the reoccurring electoral irregularities and fraud. Though there are some technical provisions to even the playing field and an electoral authority, they are basically ineffective. Haiti is rated 1 accordingly.

Disqualifications included insanity/mental illness, criminal conviction, imprisonment, persons under guardianship/wards, holders of temporary entry permits, and undocumented immigrant. ( Source: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2137_B.htm ) Conclusion: Given that Haiti has numerous reasons like incarceration for disqualification from suffrage, but not restrictive on more arbitrary, unalienable grounds like race, ethnicity, or gender, Haiti is rated 2 accordingly. Question 3 Haiti has numerous (mostly small) political parties who field candidates in elections. The smaller Haitian political parties often form alliances and coalitions. A broad alliance of democratically minded parties known as the Democratic Convergence (Convergence Démocratique ¯# CD) provides the most distinguishable opposition to Lavalas Family (Fanmi Lavalas ¯# FL) -the party with, generally, the most support. Other coalitions attempting to unite smaller parties include the Alliance for the Liberation and Advancement of Haiti (ALAH), Grand Center Right Front Coalition, and Haitian Greater Socialist Party (Grand Parti Socialiste Haïtien ¯# GPSH) [1] . Whilst the opposition can exert limited influence in the form of boycotting elections and political demonstrations, they have little in the way of democratically coming to power. Often there is a deadlock between the incumbency and the opposition, with the need for international assistance to broker an agreement. This is, in part, due to the perpetual instability of the system [2] . Conclusion: Even with the presence of an 'opposition', which is no singular formidable party rather a coalition, they exert little influence over the system. Therefore it can't really be said they are effective, nor can they, as evident, come to be democratically elected into power. Haiti is rated 1 accordingly. [1] http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf [2] https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2006/haiti#.VV3xOet63zQ Question 4 One form of power is the ability to politically participate or be elected. Haitians can run as candidates but under quite demanding conditions; as long as they are 25 years+, are qualified electors, have Haitian citizenship by birth, full possession of civil and political rights, ownership of real property or employment/trade in the constituency, and residence in the constituency concerned for at least two consecutive years. Disqualifiers are imprisonment, insanity/mental illness, conviction of a criminal offence, persons under guardianship/wards, holders of temporary entry permits, undocumented immigrants, executives and members of the Electoral Commission, managers of public funds who may stand for election but are relieved of their duties if elected, agents of companies or corporations that are government contractors, government officials who did not resign at least six months before the elections, and members of the executive branch and directors general of public administration bodies who did not resign at least one year before the elections. ( Source: http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2137_B.htm ) But since there is little-to-no political stability or functioning government, and with competing basic needs such as food, income, and education (which Haiti desperately struggles with), the actuality for most Haitians is minimal. There is no recourse to referendum which, I suspect, wouldn't be viable anyway since civil society is quite removed from the political sphere (which itself is instable and almost non existent) . Conclusion: The small provisions for political power, like being a candidate or, presumably public office, is rendered ineffective since pressing domestic issues like poverty and illiteracy, as well as an unstable and shifting political landscape means little-to-none political power can effectively be accessed. Haiti is rated 0 accordingly. Question 5 Radio has the widest reach in Haiti with more than 300 radio stations believed to broadcast throughout the country. 'Talk show programs serve as one of the few ways in which ordinary Haitians can speak out about politics and the government. A law passed in 1997 declares the airwaves to be the property of the government, but at least 133 unlicensed radio stations operate freely. In addition, there are 50 community-based stations throughout the country.' [1] Freedom House rated Haiti not free regarding press in 2002, with a score of 72/100. Independent 'radio stations and newspapers exist in name only. Those critical of the government are targets of official intimidation and of inspired mob attacks. 'Television is state run and strongly biased toward the government. In December 2001, Brignol Lindor, news director of Radio Eco 2000, was stoned and hacked to death by an allegedly pro-Aristide mob' . Harassment, intimidation, and self-censorship from fear of violent retribution are commonplace [2] . Conclusion: Few outlets of independent media exist and those that do are heavily oppressed and censored (either by self or externally through violent silencing means) . Haiti was therefore rated 1 accordingly. [1] http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf [2] https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2006/haiti#.VV3xOet63zQ CIVIL LIBERTIES Question 1 Rule of law has never been good in Haiti, but during 2001-2004, there was an intensification of political violence, economic recession, and a breakdown of government institutions and the rule of law [1] . The government also perpetuated its violation when, 'throughout 2002 and 2003 the government orchestrated attacks on opposition demonstrations by police and government-supported gangs known as chimères ' [2] . Though the constitution guarantees a full range of political rights and civil liberties, the protection of these rights in 2000 'remained precarious, as the rule of law was tenuous at best, and the situation was aggravated by a yawning security vacuum' [3] . There is plain disregard for rules and laws by justice actors [4] but also a great deal of uncertainty about what the law is [5] . Conclusion: Overall Haiti has little to show for its legal provisions, which are routinely (perpetuated by government agents no less) in the midst of political instability. Haiti rates a 0 accordingly. [1] http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf [2] http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf [3] https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2006/haiti#.VV3xOet63zQ [4] http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/PB%2018%20Rule%20of%20Law%20in%20Haiti%20After%20the%20Earthquake.pdf [5] http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/haiti_rol.pdf Question 2 In practice, many provisions are not observed, a poor human rights record. Issues include 'arbitrary and political killings, kidnapping, disappearances, torture, and unlawful arrest and incarceration& especially during periods of coups or attempted coups' [1] . Haiti's criminal laws predate the development of international human rights instruments and therefore do not contain these fundamental guarantees. Indeed, certain criminal offenses actively violate the rights of the ordinary Haitian human rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of association. For example, 'twenty persons or more who gather to discuss religion, politics and literary issues without official permission of the government are committing a criminal offense' [2] . More here . Conclusion: Despite legal provisions, Haiti clearly has numerous issues in all areas of its society. With such widespread abuse and criminality, as well as archaic criminal laws aiding violations, Haiti rates 1 accordingly. [1] http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf [2] http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/haiti_rol.pdf Question 3 Haiti's constitution calls for an independent judiciary to interpret the country's laws. The constitution guarantees defendants the right to a fair public trial, including the presumption of innocence and the right to be present at trial, to present witnesses and evidence in their own defense, and to confront witnesses against them. In practice, however these rights are often denied. Moreover, the government is not required to provide free counsel, and many Haitians cannot afford representation on their own. Haiti has 'a weak and corrupt police force and a weak judiciary' with 'persistent dysfunctions in the administration of justice' . This has encouraged prolonged pretrial detention and legal impunity, and use of excessive, sometimes deadly force in controlling demonstrations and making arrests. Further, the Haitian National Police perpetuate some of the criminality by committing arbitrary killings and disappearances [1] . Threats of violence often render judges and juries unable to make impartial decisions. Bribes not only sway judges but also taint potential witnesses. In addition to corruption, the judicial system is under-staffed and under-funded. The combination of corruption and inefficiency has resulted in a serious backlog of criminal cases and an overflow in the country's jails [2] . More here and here . Conclusion: Evident in the multiple problems of corruption, understaffing and underfunding combined with weak infrastructure, the judiciary is far from fair and independent despite constitutional and legal provisions. Haiti rates a 0 accordingly. [1] http://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32294.pdf [2] http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf Question 4 Haiti has a stark absence of checks and balances, let alone ones that are effective. Whilst technically judiciary is independent from the executive, it has little independence and is heavily corrupted. The Catholic Church and few other NGOs bring a slight balance by continuing to be voices of limited opposition. Occasionally, through international pressure and when the government resembles some structure and control, breaches are investigated. Conclusion: With little-to-no measure of accountability but with some activity of investigation, Haiti rates 1 accordingly. Question 5 Haiti's constitution doesn 't contain specific language prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex, language, age, or disability, and, despite some working standards intended to protect women, few resources exist to ensure enforcement. Abuses against women and children are common. Rape, although illegal, rarely results in prosecution of the perpetrator. Haitian law excuses a husband for murdering his wife if the wife is found in an adulterous affair. Trafficking of children is a significant problem, with UNICEF estimating that 2,000 to 3,000 Haitian children per year are trafficked [1] . Further, there is racial discrimination: 'A small light-skinned wealthy business and professional elite located in the capital city controls most of Haiti's economy and decision-making. The mulatto population makes up half of this elite. Most Dominicans are prosperous and are active in business, as are many Syrian and Lebanese who are involved with trading. The large black majority is excluded from all formal political and economic participation.' [2] Conclusion: Haiti clearly has discriminatory activity against minority groups, well entrenched in society and a political and economic impediment. This is made worse by the absence of remedial laws or recourse to justice. Haiti is rated 0 accordingly. [1] http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf [2] http://www.minorityrights.org/2571/haiti/haiti-overview.html Corruption Summary Haiti is a hotbed for corruption on all levels, made worse by the rampant political instability and weak infrastructures. There are entrenched systems of patronage, corruption, and inefficiency [1] . There is official corruption and high levels of crime, including drug trafficking [2] and judges and officials who accept bribes. [3] The police force suffers from mismanagement and corruption [4] and the justice system is rife with excessive pretrial detention and long delays in the penal process, corruption, involvement of government officials in money laundering and drug trafficking and pursuit of private interests. [5] Elections are heavily tainted with fraud, as the Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission, claimed about the 2000 presidential elections. [6] Observers also made increasing charges of corruption occuring between 2001-2004 with one investigation claim citing embezzlement of millions of dollars of public funds. 'The Central Unit for Financial Information reported that millions of dollars in public funds were illegally transferred to private institutions created by (2001-2004) President Aristide and that an estimated $20 million were transferred to personal foreign accounts belonging to him. [7] Transparency International went back as 2005 for Haiti, ranking it 155 out of 159 in 2005, with a CPI score of 1.8 from only 4 surveys due to lack of access (3 surveys are the minimum required for entry) [8] In 2006 it ranked the lowest at 163, with 1.8 from just 3 surveys.

Early 2012 marks the end of the Yemeni Revolution and the beginning of new but hotly contested regime, making research after 2012 difficult to consider. The evidence considered to answer the questions, once again came from a variety of sources but the information despite being helpful, it did not provide enough detail to directly answer some of the questions without making some judgment calls. The justification to this is at least from my research alone, is that there is little available information that can straightforwardly answer some of the difficult questions. The evidence that I sourced can be analysed as being quite vague at one end, only offering the extent of corruption throughout Yemen and broad conclusions, and specific at the other end, giving specific examples and statistics. This makes justifying my answers overall easier, but in some areas doubtful. As a result of this, some of the questions answered were left to educated guesses but much like the case of Sudan, the general consensus is that Yemen is rifled with corruption and faces some of the same challenges. This has made gauging what answers to choose less doubtful and more informed. Some of the questions were indeed difficult to answer not only because of lack of detailed information related to the question, but because some of the questions had limited scope. Some had options were too narrow and some too broad to make absolute definitive answers, in that they either included too little description or too much. Given the years chosen and data that was available, my research suggests answers that generally fit well with the options and did not suggest anything notable to the contrary. The research undertaken provided a lot of analytical data which was ideal in justifying some of the answers and where it did not, I feel confident that my judgement and findings will be accurate with the dynamics of corruption that had taken place between 1990 and 2012. Below is a list of the sources and SOME of the evidence quoted (Some sources contained a great deal of general information whereas other had not so much) . It would be impractical here to give all of the evidence consulted in answering the questions, so extracts of good evidence have been given. Sources: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/yemen Yemen is not an electoral democracy. Past elections, while more competitive than in many Arab countries, have been marred by flaws including vote buying, the partisanship of public officials and the military, and exploitation of state control over key media platforms. Corruption is an endemic problem. Despite some recent efforts by the government to fight graft, Yemen lacks most legal safeguards against conflicts of interest http://yemen.usembassy.gov/root/pdfs/reports/yemen-corruption-assessment.pdf 'Since the early 1990s, Yemen has held a series of popular elections at the local, parliamentary and presidential levels. While the elections have constituted a step forward, they have also been plagued by problems and questions. Those problems include the overly partisan system of administering the elections, questions over the integrity of voter rolls, greater difficulties for opposition members to register as candidates, irregular polling places and rules in presidential elections, concerns over the printing and safekeeping of ballots and ballot boxes, the abuse of government facilities to privilege the GPC and its candidates and unsatisfactory election dispute mechanism' 'Yemen has all the usual attributes that create a permissive environment for rampant corruption, typically defined as the misuse of entrusted authority for private gain. As one of the poorest and least developed states in the world, Yemen suffers from weak state institutions with under skilled and under-paid state employees' 'The most common form of administrative corruption in Yemen is the taking of a bribe by a government employee.' 'Yemen's judiciary is reportedly rife with corruption. Judges are often bribed, and, in some cases, may be able to choose from the higher bribe offered by the competing parties to a case.' https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/17179-yemens-saleh-netted-60bn-through-corruption The corrupt practices of Yemen's former leader Ali Abdullah Saleh have netted the strongman up to $60 billion, a UN sanctions panel will report to the Security Council on Tuesday.

Ever since, in the absence of a system of control and accountability, it is now reflected in every area of public and private affairs. w. Corruption and patronage networks are running the country's public affairs, which has led to weak government performance, and the creation of corrupt power blocs that control public resources.

"Uganda",2005,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Question 21: Technically there are elections in Uganada but in reality this does not mean much. In 2005, people voted to re-introduced the multi-party system and in 2006 Museveni was elected as President (had laready been in power since 1986, he had been 'elected twice before but had no opposition previously) . However this election received criticism from the international community due to initimidation of the opposition and a strong media bias. The 2010 primary elections were suspended due to violence. The 2011 election was again won by Museveni but there were reports (mainly by the opopsition) of vote rigging. This information is from BBC's profile of Uganda. Question 22: The constitution allows all adults to vote in the elections however Freedom House expresses issues of intimdation in reagrds to voters planning to vote for the opposition. Question 23: There is strong opposition to Museveni's National Resistance Movement, namely Kizza Besigye of the Forum for Democratic Change party. However is is difficult for opposition to gain power over Museveni as there is strong media bias and intimidation of its potential voters. This information is from artices from the BBC. Question 24: While the constitution allows people to participate in the country's politics by running for positions or simply voting, this is not as common as in a well established community due to fear and mistrust in the system. I looked at Freedom Houses' reports for this information. Question 25: The constitution allows freedom of the press however he media in Uganda faces fear and harrassment namely by political leaders. They are intimidated into publishing bias information favouring the NRM and fear prosecution for libel or treason if they speak out against the government. Information from Freedom House. Question 26: The US Aid Organisation provides information regarding Uganda's lack of transparency and accountability, key features in the rule of law. The government is not treated equally before the law allowing abuses of power inconsistent with the rule of law. Question 27: The constitution protects human rights however some rights such as the freedom of expression is not supported due to the libel and treason as reported by Freedom House. Question 28: The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Uganda, Benjamin Odoki, has said himself the judiciary is not free and independant due to government interference, limited resources and lack of respect for court decisions by the government. In 2007 there was a seige of the High Court were opposition supporters were arrested and in some instances beaten. This was met by a week long strike by the courts according to the Jurist's reports. Question 29: The government has complete power with no checks or balances in place that would allow the judiciary or legislature to hold the government accountable. The governemnt often uses initimdation techniques to supress those who critisize them. Question 30: Minority religions such as Muslims are relatively free to follow their own religion. However there are aspects of life for minorities where they find themselves not receiving equal treatment by the government as illustrated by the Minority Rights Group International. Question 31: Although I have done research on this topic, I am still finding it difficult to get my head around Uganda's politics as I came into topic knowing nothing and have found many issues with the country's politics. I have used reliable sources as well as more opinion based pieces to form my answers and this should give a rounded answer. Question 32: Uganda received a ratin gof only 26 of 100 on the Corruption Perception Index last year showing the people do not have trust in their government as they fear public funds are being misused by officials who have no accountability. Question 33: Reports by the Human RIghts Watch and International Business Times, there is grave conern for corruption in Uganda's politics particularly with government officials using fund for private purposes with no benefit to the public.",1,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,5,3,8
"Nepal",2005,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","The range of dates chosen were based upon Nepal's rapid shifts in political regime-type over the past three decades. Around 1990 Nepal transitioned from absolute monarchy, a regime that had lasted since the 18 th Century, to constitutional monarchy due to significant political pressure from communist groups like the Maoist party. In 2008, the regime type again changed as the monarchy was disestablished completely, marking Nepal's shift to a tentative republic, the constitution of which is still being drafted today. There was a regal imposition of martial law in 2005 which led to the regime change in 2008, a short period which is important to understand before defining the present regime's shape. Thus, my broad area of study is between 2005 and 2015, in order to comprehend the political context which led to different structures of regime type/government and subsequent differing levels of democracy, but the specific focus is from 2007 onward, due to that being the point of changeover for the present regime . Nepal used a mixture of direct election (much like an FPP constituency system) and proportional representation in the first true republican elections of 2008. While these elections were not falsified by an incumbent authoritarian regime, they were certainly not free and fair: Maoists, knowing Nepalese were sick of violence from the war against King Gyanendra, threatened to resume war if they were beaten at the polls ( The Economist ) . Various different factions, not just the Maoists, sent thugs to threaten voters. In this respect, the election was manipulated by all sides equally. Thus, while the Maoists won, they did not win an outright majority to form a government, and their relative success can be put to other parties being perceived as corrupt as much as it being a result of intimidation ( The Economist ) . Foreign observers reported no large-scale vote tampering by any one party, and by all accounts the fact that the result created the need for a minority coalition means the number themselves were accurate ( The Economist ) . I awarded the election question a '2', but in reality the question was not suited for a non-incumbent type election such as this. It presumed that the only elections were either authoritarian (whether rigged or partly-free) or fully democratic in style, based on the strength of opposition. There was no leeway for a regime changeover where no incumbent existed; I used my discretion here. Suffrage was once again from Index Mundi (see references) : &gt;18 years and universal. On the question of whether opposition is likely to gain power, I considered that in 2007/2008 there was no incumbent for opposition to be oppressed by, and therefore shifted focus as to whether there was an equal chance for each party to govern, which there was ( The Economist ) . Unusually, this required a '3' to be given even though Nepal was in the process of democratising, when this score would normally be given to an established, embedded democracy. The question of access to power is an interesting one. By all accounts, the initial republican election of 2008 was fair game for any political party, but with Nepal having previously been a constitutional monarchy, there were specific major parties which were known to the public and therefore more favoured -though the Maoists were not a major party under the previous system, they were a well-known underground movement (Lawoti 132-134) . There is little information available on independents who ran, or if there were any at all. The election was centred around political parties, and a ccess to political parties was likely not barred by poverty, as the Maoist example shows: they were a grass-roots based faction arising from 'extreme inequality in income and political power [emphasis mine] ' (Shrestha) . Conversely, Nepal has an ongoing issue with caste divisions (Lawoti 132), which doubtless prevented lower caste members like the untouchables from wielding political power (Shrestha) . Dalits (untouchables) were granted some basic rights in 2003 like citizenship and the ability to buy/sell houses, but there remain deep divisions in Nepalese society (Lawoti 134) . Political rights, along with many other fundamental rights, are on paper guaranteed free from interference by the executive, by the 1990 constitution (Singh 306) . The rule of law and judiciary questions are relevant here. Judicial independence is guaranteed in the 1990 constitution under Article 88, as are habeus corpus rights, and in practise these are at least partially upheld (Singh 307) . The executive is in theory subject to the rule of law, which is checked by judicial review, and the Supreme Court may strike down legislation inconsistent with fundamental rights (307) . Even after the 2007 regime shift, the Supreme Court remains powerful enough to rule on the extent of parliament's sovereignty (309) . Media freedom 'improved dramatically' in Nepal around in 2007, and continued to increase over time until 2012 (Freedom of the Press Report 2007-2013) . The change occurred as a result of increasing concessions from King Gyanendra until the attempted transition to republican democracy, which is ongoing (Freedom House 2007) .Where previously media outlets received sanctions for running anti-royalist rhetoric under the monarchy, they have more recently received threats for programming which is seen as unfavourable to the Maoists; the facti on 'continue [s] to regularly intimidate, detain, kidnap, and assault reporters' (Freedom House 2007) . Problematically, the question on media censorship only looked at the issue in light of government-driven censorship, without room for intimidation by individual parties, as was the case here.

This is due to the military run regime that, despite electoral processes taking place, have effectively assumed governing position regardless of the outcome or used military personnel to run as Prime Ministerial canidates such as Thein Sein in the 2010 election. The SPDC party, the governing military party in question rigged the 2010 elections, leading to the boycotting of the opposition party, which means there is no adequate political opposition. Civil Liberties: One point was given for human rights as despite human rights abuses by the military run government, changes since the 2010 election has seen less violence and human rights abuses. However the abuses committed prior included killings and beatings by police and military towards protesting ethnic minorities. The treatment of the ethinic minorities is extremely poor and this classification system does not provide adequate weighting on the scale of human rights. Corruption: Government have constantly mis-used the government resources of police and military.",0,3,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,4,2,6
"Niger",1989,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","As a result of the military coup in Niger in 2010, a new constitution was adopted which reinstated key attributes to Niger's struggling democratic system. These included limits for executive terms and the necessary curbing of executive power in the country. Presidential and municipal elections were then taken in 2011 which have been subsequently been declared free and fair by a number of international observers and political commentators. There are three major political parties in Niger which together possessed nearly 80% of the nation's votes during the 2011 election showing a dispersion of political force often seen in successful democratic countries with the potential (as of 2011 at least) to change hands from one party to another with relative ease. Suffrage in Niger is universal, meaning anyone over the age of 18 has the right to vote. Women have been able to vote and stand for election since 1948. Current president Mahamadou Issoufou has attempted to promote a cabinet of half-hearted plurality, hiring previous opposition members to ministerial positions while retaining the key placements in the cabinet for his political party. This assures that without previous interaction within Nigerien politics it is difficult for outsiders to become involved in the goings-on of parliament as long time politicians have been chosen as a preference. The media of Niger is diversely split between public and private entities. Although there has been a number of occasions where free speech has been curbed following the arrest of journalists, many West African observers view Nigerien press independent and capable of antagonizing the government. The Rule of Law is where Niger seriously implicates itself on this scale. Although the constitution provides for an independent judiciary, at times there has been a evidence of executive interference. As well as this, the president has the ability to appoint judges and the Ministry of Justice strictly supervises public prosecutors. Corruption in the judicial realm is due to low salaries and inadequate training with prisons overpopulated and plagued with poor health conditions. Human Rights in Niger have vastly improved since the inception of the first constitution in 1999 and furthermore the second constitution in 2010. However there is still some criticism levied at the country. Freedoms of Association and Assembly, Speech and Expression and Mobility are ultimately protected by legislation however the ongoing slavery and child labor which has plagued the country, continues to this day with 43,000 slaves present. Nigerien society, though largely Muslim, reflects a tolerance towards other religions. In terms of representation of minorities, Niger's constitution reserves 8 seats in an attempt to ensure representation in the National Assembly, however ethnic minorities in Niger continue to have unsatisfactory access to government services. The Hausa and Songhai have long dominated Nigerien politics, often conflicting with Tuareg and Toubou herders which remains a serious problem. Corruption runs rampant through all levels of Nigerien society with bribery commonplace to counterbalance poor wages. Transparency has been a concern regarding uranium mining contracts in Niger, and although the 2010 constitution addressed some of these concerns, corruption remains a huge issue in Niger. Niger was ranked 134th/183 countries surveyed in Transparency International's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index.",3,3,3,2,3,2,2,2,2,1,5,0,14,9,23
"Malawi",1998,2003,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Other""","Malawi Malawi is one of the lesser developed countries in the world, however in the last 4 years since the 2010 transparency international corruption rating, Malawi has jumped 60 positions to 110/175 with a score of 33. During 2002, the year selected for me, Malawi faced a food crisis. I thought it would be interesting to see the political history prior to this time, and the influence elites and the political system had on the food crisis. Not to go too far back into different regimes, i selected to look at the events leading up to the 1999 election and beyond, up until the end of the food crisis in 2003. For Question 20, I decided to focus on the 1999 election. The president at the time, Bakili Muluzi was effectively able to choose candidates to run against, rather than leaving it up to the parties members (1) . This worried many party candidates who feared Muluzi was becoming autocratic in intent, leaving nothing up to the rest of the party. With a country in a dire economic situation, a rapidly diminishing climate which destroyed a large amount of crops and with it the economy and the emergence of an increasingly autocratic leader had corruption written all over it. Along side of this the two main political leaders at the time were in the two main religious groups in Malawi causing contention between the Muslim and Christian communities. The Opposition parties accused Muluzi's party (United Democratic Front, UDF) of abusing power to actively increase poverty and fear in the hopes of coercing voters to vote for him. He rejected this claim basing the increased in crime and death rates to the poor economic situation of the country and the climate (1) (2) . These strong accusations alone, even if false are enough to raise an eyebrow that Malawi's government contains a strong level of corruption. Malawi currently 'officially' does have universal suffrage, but as stated earlier, with the accusations in place, and the situation of the country at this time its relatively safe to say that Malawi's suffrage was not universal. Not all people have access to gain power. President Bakili Muluzi 's son Atupele is currently the leader of the UDF in 2015, and took over immediately after Bakili stepped down. Although the opposition party led by Peter Mutharika is currently in parliament, to gain access to power positions often relies on networking, familial ties or monetary bribes. Once in parliament elites will focus on what can keep them in power, nationalism, ideology, status, professional pride and tactics and strategies to maximise self gain (4) . It was a very power orientated time, where a country in crisis needed solidarity, but it wasn't received. It was not uncommon for Elites to argue that no matter what structures and policies they put in place, it was the fault of the people, or of the land, or of something that was out of their control. Rather than owning up at taking the problem they would fight to stay in power, even on unjust terms (4) . Media in Malawi is uniform, with one major radio station provider, one TV provider and one prominent newspaper. It is either owned by the government or by private operators. Because of this, media penetration in Malawi is low. Also the literacy rate in Malawi (2010) was just 72%. Transparency rates 2014 Malawi Media as being very corrupt at 146/179. I made an educated guess that at a time where resources where scarce in Malawi, regulations on media would not have taken priority. With speculations revolving around intentional government violence at this time freedom of speech and expression was very limited. Violence was often used to suppress opposition views. This was also only a few short years after the Rwandan genocide and other African political reforms, so violence -although not acceptable -was seen as a tool to gain/ maintain power. Interestingly (transparency international) Malawi ranks much more highly on judicial independence than in any other category (5) . However during the time period that I am focused on (1998-2003) poor preparation and foresight from the government contributed greatly to the lack of food and the economic downfall of Malawi. Private traders were allowed to buy maize (primary food of Malawi at this time) and mark up the price dramatically, basically ripping of local producers desperately in need of food. The government attempted to place a band aid fix of aid on the situation by importing from bordering countries, but the man power and money involved really didn't make up for the small amount of relief it brought. Poor relations with other countries governments didn't help the process (6) . At an educated guess independent bodies to take action were limited. Even if they had existed at the time, the amount of corruption that was not acted upon suggests these bodies took no real action. * This is not a complaint, more a suggestion for next years class -to help them with the assignment. I found this assignment very confusing. I found a big blank text space with 4 unique questions above it quite unsettling. I Didnt know the structure the written part was supposed to take, and weather references needed to be cited formally, just referenced or not referenced at all. I tried to make the most of what i understood to be the correct way in which to approach this assignment but found it difficult. Again not a complaint just something i had difficulty understanding. Thanks Xavier -other than that enjoyed the class this year!

"Spain",1939,1975,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","Political Rights: Franco's regime rejected the idea of party politics. For the Francoists, politics meant division, confrontation, and ultimately civil war (Sanchez 2010:50) . Instead the regime created an alternative political system, with the creation of only one party; FET-JONS (which stands for Falange Espanola Tradicinalista de las Juntas de Ofensivas Nacional-Sindicalistas, otherwise known as the Falange) of which Franco named himself lifelong leader. The party was riddled with corruption, taking on the adage 'To the friend the favour, to the enemy the law' (Sanchez 2010:51) . City councils and the parliament were made up of people who hand selected and allowed to run for local elections, which were seen as little more than award ceremonies. Thus creating a party made up of friends to the party, and not free and fair elections. These elected officials were willing to call in favours for their friends if the need arouse (Sanchez) . Although there was occasionally candidates with differing idea from Francoism, who would slip through the cracks and become elected, creating a sort of opposition within the party. This was very rare and referred to as mistakes, and precautions were taken to make sure it didn't happen much, 'As the governor of Soria explained in preparation for that year's elections, candidates suspected of harbouring 'bastard intentions' should be legally eliminated from the race to avoid 'surprises' .' (Sanchez 2010:55) . Under Franco the mass media was strictly controlled and regulated (Heywood 1995:57) . Civil Liberties: Under Franco's Spain many people did not have basic freedoms. Francoism suppressed people who openly held political thoughts against the regime, so the people repressed their feelings and hid behind silence: 'People soon learnt that silence and outward submission were essential to survive' (Sanchez 2010:33), 'Ordinary people did things because the authorities said so' (Sanchez 2010:42) . The Judiciary system was clearly corrupt and ran towards the regimes best interests. People we imprisoned and executed without trial and based on affiliations against the regime: 'Executions were only supposed to come at the end of a legal process, but quite often they were the culmination of a tragic parody of justice& one day, in the provincial prison of Murcia, the director of the jail ad his guards pointed randomly at five men as the inmates marched past them. All five were shoot soon afterwards' (Sanchez 2010:31) . As the whole system was based on the regimes best interest, there was no checks or balances, at all, to make sure power was not miss used. Power was constantly misused to keep the fear, of the regime, strong within the people of Spain. Sanchez talks about the 'secret world' that was Franco's prison system, where there was no official records of the actual prisons and there abuses (2010:30) . Thus making it impossible to have any sort regulatory system. The poor landless peasants of Spain suffered the most. There was no means to protect them and they were routinely suppressed into submission (Heywood 1995, Sanchez 2010) . Francoist even claimed that the poor peasantry were biologically inferior, making them social outcasts, degenerate and resentful individuals (Sanchez 2010:22) . Corruption: Corruption in Franco's regime was extreme. It was almost to the point that he encouraged it as it tied people to his regime (Payne 1987:399) . Franco when told of corruption had an interesting tactic of letting the accused know that they had been informed on (399) . Sanchez has many accounts about people calling in favours from friends who have a seat in the public sector (2010) . 'Franco seems to have regarded corruption as a necessary lubrication for the system' (Payne 1987:399) . Reference: Heywood, Paul 1995. The Government and Politics of Spain Payne, Stanley G. 1987.

"Ethiopia",1991,2010,"""Bribe-taking by public officials""","Ethiopia with one of the biggest population in Africa, was got rid of the authoritarian regime under Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991, by a revolt group known as TPLF (Tigray Peoples Liberation Front) (Gudina, 2011) . After many years under absolute Monarchy and military dictatorship, Ethiopia slightly transferred to democratic multi party system politics. In 1991 after they overthrew the Derg regiem the TPLF, led by late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi did not waste time to establish its political dominance. With other ethnic based political organisations they formed coalition called EPRDF (Ethiopia people's revolutionary democratic front) which in turn formed transitional government of Ethiopia and subsequently Meles Zenawi became the first president. The party announced its aspiration to democratise Ethiopia (Human rights watch, 2002) . The transitional government of Ethiopia lasted until 1995, in 1995 new constitution was ratified, the new constitution clearly addresses human rights issues as well is the relationship between three main government bodies: executive, legislative and judiciary, this was something which was not implemented from the beginning (Negash & Negash, 2008) . In 1995 the national election board of Ethiopia, set May 1995 for election. Small parties contested in the election alongside hundreds of independent candidates.to accommodate millions of voters more than 40,000 voting stations were prepared, EPRDF won overwhelmingly and transferred itself from transitional government Federal republic of Ethiopia (Ethiopian general election, 1995) . The United States, EU, Canada as well as UN and African Union send observers. According to Wikipedia, despite the praise by the observers many political parties boycotted, because of many of their members were harassed, beaten, prohibited from travelling, some like Dr Asrat Woldeyes secretary general of Amhara people's organisation was jailed and sentenced to two years. The election resulted the parliament has 108 seats in the house of federation, and 547 seats in the house of people's representatives (Ethiopian general election, 1995) . According to the constitution the prime minister holds the highest executive power and he is from the ruling party and elected by parliament. While the president is head of state and directly elected by (parliament Ethiopian parliamentary information) . IN 2010 election in Ethiopia was overshadowed by the war with Eritrea caused by the border dispute, the opposition openly blamed the ruling party to held election while the country was in active war against its neighbour. The ruling party easily managed to retain the power with majority on both (houses freedom house, 2011) . President Negaso GI dada however was replaced by Girma Woldegiorgis, they both are from minor political parties, but according to constitution the president is just honorary position the prime minister run the country. However critics by the opposition parties and human rights organisations intensified against the ruling party because of the widespread human rights abuse, crack down on journalists and political dissidents (Ethiopian review, 2011) . 2005 election was a wake call for the ruling party, the main opposition party which was locally known as Kinijit, made a significant progress and won many seats across Ethiopia in parliamentarian election, observers said the opposition parties to have won 172 seats, from 12 seats in previous election. When the result announced the opposition parties called on their supporters to demonstrate on the streets against what they called the EPRDF's fraudulent (Lyons, 2005) . The demonstration turned violent subsequently security forces opened fire against demonstrators and hundreds were died. Hundreds of opposition party's leaders and members were arrested and some sentenced to life, journalists were also detained and prosecuted. This outraged the human rights organisations without making any impact to the ruling elites in Addis Ababa.2010 election was different than 2005 one the regime won by 99.6% which puts question mark over the transparency of election ( voice of America, 2005) . According to many Ethiopian friends, Transition to democratic system in Ethiopia started well, comparing with its neighbouring countries such as Eritrea, but some where it lost its compass. Even though the country has all the necessary institutions for basic democracy, however the country lack institutions that check and balance, and held the officials accountable. For example the judiciary is more or less independent, however it is politically influenced, sometimes can be used as an instrument by the ruling elite to prosecute dissidents my (Ethiopian friend) .

"Peru",1990,2000,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","For the questions on elections and effective opposition, I looked at the elections in Peru and it shows that power is able to change hands in elections and that there is an effective opposition that is able to be elected. Suffrage was granted for women in Peru in 1955 and for the illiterate in 1979 so for the period of 1990 to 2000 it would appear that every adult can vote. During Fujimori's first term as President he carried out and autogolpe or a self-coup. He shut down congress, suspended the constitution and purged the judiciary. This shows Fujimori consolidating power and giving him power to pass his legislation. He called for elections to a democratic constitutional congress where left leaning parties took part with Fujimori's supporters winning a majority in the body. A referendum scheduled shortly after approved the coup and the constitution of 1993 but only by a small margin of 4 or 5 percent. The media in Peru started with a newspaper called El Peruano. From this other newspapers started with one called the La Republica ardently opposing Fujimori's government. This shows that the media is able to act as a check and balance. The El Peruano is the official newspaper of record and as such all laws must be published in the daily newspaper. This seems to show some level of government influence but not to the extent where the newspaper is told what to print. For questions 26, 27, 28 and 29 I looked to the human rights watch world reports for 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1997 which showed that law is generally followed but there are significant breaches in the form of due process in the courts, torture, extrajudicial executions and 'disappearances'being committed by the government in their war against the Sendero Lumnioso (Shining Path) . For question 30 I looked at the world directory of minorities and indigenous peoples. They say that indigenous people during Fujimori's reign had laws which were meant to protect their rights to land around the Amazon basin but which were ignored by the government in order to attract foreign direct investment. Fujimori is currently serving sentences in prison for human rights abuses and embezzlement. In 2000 Fujimori was charged with corruption but he took refuge in Japan. Upon his return to Peru in 2006 he was charged and convicted of corruption and embezzlement and is serving concurrent sentences with the stiffest sentence being 25 years.

"Mauritania",1992,2012,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Other""","The resources I used as my reference were; Transparency International's country profile on Mauritania that can be found at http://www.transparency.org/country#MRT, the country's profile by the BBC at thttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13881985, the US' Central Intelligence Agency's profile on the country at https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mr.html and the organisation Anti-Slavery at http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/descent_based_slavery/slavery_in_mauritania/default.aspx Mauritania lies in the western end of the Saharan desert where it meets with the Atlantic, where the country's capital Nouakchott is situated. The centralised power of the government is also based in the city which is home to about a third of the country's 3.5 million population. The political scene within the country has been characterised by unstable governments, ineffective economic policies, military coups and ethnic conflicts mainly pitting the ruling Moor/Arab-Berber population against the Black Mauritanians who are often disenfranchised within their own country. The Moorish/Arab population of Mauritania sees the Black Maurtanians as 'Senegalse' as Senegal is Mauritania's immediate neighbour to the south and it's people share similar customs and traditions to the Black population in the south of Mauritania. This has caused tensions that eventually simmered into a conflict within Mauritania and eventually between Mauritania and Senegal in 1989 displacing tens of thousands of Black Mauritanians. Slavery is prevalent in Mauritania, with which is a source of strong international criticism mainly coming from the United Nations, the United States and member countries of the European Union has one of the highest rates of slavery in the world. Different groups such as the Walk Free Foundation and Anti Slavery International put their estimates at 4 and 18 percent respectively. Other estimates go as high as 20% of the population or 600,000 people are living as slaves in Mauritania, completely devoid of human rights let alone any socio-economic or socio-political rights. Mauritania has seen a relatively stable growth in its economy during these years that can be attributed to the rich mineral reserves in the country and the investment into some agricultural and construction industries in the more stable parts of the country. However most observers such as the African Economic Outlook suggests that the country's economic potential has not yet been realised, citing that the lack of government initiative and the absence of a strong economic policy (that can be backed by a stable regime) hinders the economy. Government instability has plagued Mauritania almost in its entire history, an insecure security situation post-independence prevented a robust democratic way of governance to come about post-independence from France in 1960, mostly due to rival claims against Morocco over Western Sahara and the competition between Algeria and Morocco to exert political influence over Mauritania itself, not excluding the US and the European powers. Frequent government turnovers and multiple military coups have derailed Mauritania away from democracy with the current president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz being elected in 2009. He came to power in 2005 after a military operation that overthrew then president Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. As Transparency International's report places the country in 124th place out of 175 countries, corruption is prevalent in Mauritania, abuse of power is common and the rule of law is only applicable to enfranchised/wealthy individuals and group of people. It suggests the country's political system is rigged to benefit the ruling elite disregarding the interests of the greater general population. Political Stability has been one of the greater challenges in Mauritania. Election results have been questioned by domestic and international bodies in more than one occasion. Coups that replace existing 'elected' governments are mostly overthrown by members of the military, with the military citing a multitude of reasons over the years including economic problems, abuse of political power in part as a reason to overthrow the preceding government among others. World Bank's estimates that 42% of the population of Mauritania live in poverty. (http://data.worldbank.org/country/mauritania) . A huge chunk of its population is uneducated with only 58.6 able to read and write (UNICEF statistics http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/mauritania_statistics.html) the country's population has little in terms of political and social rights that they enjoy in practice.The country's other political institutions in the legislative and the judiciary are undermined by the authority of the executive. Non-governmental institutions are also subject to state interference, some censorship and are mostly prevented from discrediting the ruling party or the military. Overall the profile pictured by information available from the aforementioned sources above suggest the political landscape in Mauritania as undemocratic",1,3,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,0,4,1,10,4,14
"Slovakia",1990,2009,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government""","These are some facts that I have highlighted on the justication of Slovakia's political system : Slovakia is an electoral democracy, voters get to elect their president for a five-year term. Civil and political rights of its citizens are way better than some of its neighbouring countries. However there are always some form of corruption going on within the elite sphere. One example would be the case with Slovakias defense minister, Frantisek Kasicky who reigned in 2008 after allegations of corruption following media stories about his overly generous tenders for barrack maintenance. Freedom of speech and expression are guaranteed by the constitution. Any restriction must be designed to protect that rights anfd liberties of its citizens as reported by Freedom House. Moreover, its media is largely free but is still vulnerable to political influence. I found this quite strange as Slovakia is a strong democracy however, it the government has its own way of dealing with the very institutions that might affect their reign. Although corruption does go on within the government, the fragmentation of its political parties that are currently in power at the moment decreases corruption to a minimum as the opposition will always keep the governing parties in check. Thus the more transparent it becomes. I found that all the questions corresponded well with the research I carried out.",3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,3,2,3,2,13,13,26

But the judiciary on one hand is lack of independence, especially noted that 'party officials, including top leaders, instruct courts how to rule on politically important cases... ' (Freedomhouse, Freedom in the World in 2002, Vietnam) . Moreover, the whole system/regime is under the control of the CPV. q30 - There is barely any ethnicity conflict or obvious discrimination in Vietnam ( http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/vietnam/viet0402-05.htm#P513_85393 ) . Although that, there is a fact that the majority ethnic is Kinh, which cover almost every position and operation in the Governing system. Minority fostering policies do exist in Vietnam ( http://web.cema.gov.vn/modules.php?name=Content&mcid=122 ) with the goal of uniting, reserving and balancing rights ( http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-2836 ) .

"Tajikistan",1997,2006,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","The period of time I studied stretches from the peace agreements after the Tajikistan Civil War in 1997 through to the 2006 Presidential election. I was able to find sufficient data to confidently answer the questions on political rights, but the questions about civil liberties were harder to answer without guessing - there is evidence of repression of human rights, but little evidence regarding the judiciary or processes to hold to government to account, and almost no evidence about ethnic groups. Question 24 about whether all people have effective access to political power was a little more difficult, as there is not a lot of information about Tajikistani politicians outside of the President, Emomali Rahmon. Question 32 on corruption was easier to answer, as there are studies from Transparency International and Freedom House showing pervasive and severe corruption throughout the government. A recent report from the OECD has commended Tajikistan for implementing some reforms since 2010, but there is still a large amount of corruption. Ultimately, Tajikistan was harder to find reliable sources and information on than Saudi Arabia, due largely to the closed nature of its government and the lack of interest in the country by most scholars and researchers.",1,3,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,4,0,8,2,10
"Thailand",2006,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","The period covered is 2006-2014, which is the time between two militaries coups in Thailand. All that time the political situation remained unstable, punctuated by several crisis. In 2007, a new constitution has been established, similar to the previous one of 1997, but expanding the range of human rights. This constitution has been cancelled in 2014 after another military coup but the data will still be studying within the framework of the 2007 one. Many of the questions above are difficult to answer because the political situation in Thailand was not calmed between 2006 and 2014, and is still quite chaotic. Another difficulty in that unstable context is that many issues may be short terms issues which do not well-reflected the political system as a whole. Finally, it is pretty hard to show the specificity of the Thai regime in that data classification exercise. Indeed, Thailand is actually ''The Kingdom of Thailand'', where the king influences the political power and can even be involved in decison-making (e.g the area of justice) . The questions above are only supposed to deal with the government, but in Thailand, the king also has a role to play in politics and has a real impact on Thai society. Political Rights : One particular element which also has to be underlined concerning the electoral process, is that the vote is actually compulsory in Thailand. The elections of the time covered have to be replaced in the unstable and political context which had obviously an impact on their proper conduct. In theory, elections in Thailand are supposed to be free and fair even though examples of blackmailing and vote buying are often noticed. An election commission also exists in Thailand, which has to look at the possible irregularities during elections. It can also disqualify candidates. Even if its tasks are supposed to ensure the democratic process of the elections, the absolute authority of its members can be a problem. The king can also play a role in the electoral process, and he seems to be seen as a legitimate authority. As an example, in may 2011, the king determined by Royal Decree that legislatives elections have to be done. Civil Liberties : In the aftermath of the 2006 coup, some freedoms have been restricted in order to cut off any kind of opposition. The situation has been untightened since then, at least until the 2014 coup. Indeed, on may the 22th of 2014, the Thai army officially announced its monopolis over all medias, until the situation will be stable and go back to normal. In term of civil liberties, an issue which has remained over the years in Thailand is the problem of human trafficking (e.g children trafficking, slavery), even if human rights are supposed to be respected in Thailand. In Thailand, it is also important to say that the actions of the executive power are checked. In the time period covered, it is interesting to notice that holding the government accountable has not really been done in an institutional level but by political opposition and by the army itself. We can take the example of the former president Thaksin Shinawtra who has been overthrown in 2006 by the military coup after it has been discovered he was involved in some corruption cases. Corruption: Corruption is something very present in Thailand, mostly in lower-levels goverment workers (trafficking, bribe tacking), but also at the higher-levels ( Thaksin Shinawtra and now his sister) . However, it seems that the corruption at the higher-levels of the state have to be taken into account through individual and occasional cases. The real problem of corruption inThailand seems to be above all the corruption at lower-levels, which is what has been underlined in the data classification.",2,2,3,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,4,1,10,9,19
"Ukraine",1991,1996,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Elections - after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine was quick to hold free elections. In 1994, more elections were held, and the incumbent was voted out. I rated this a 2 and not a 3 because there was some corruption. An example is that the elections were moved up as voted by parliament. This was not totally democratic, and resulted in some clashing between East and West Ukraine. This division will never go away. Suffrage - Educated guess here! Women had the right to vote, so I marked that all adults had this right because I can't find any information to the contrary. Political Competition - definitely! in 1991 and 1994, different parties won election, this shows that certain issues (the economy, here) are dealbreakers for Ukranians. The period goes until 1996 because thats when the constitution was enacted. Access to Political Power - I rated 2 because there was a lot of carryover between soviet rulers and people who were in power in immediate post soviet Ukraine. While this was absolutely a time of change and democratization, to say that a turnover of power happened quickly woudl be a gross miscalculation. Freedom of Press - law regulated that there would be freedom of speech, but some self regulation did absolutely occur during this vulnerable post soviet era. Civil Liberties 1 - rule of law is generally upheld. Elections being moved up, however, is an example of the malleability of law by those in power. Also, policing was still strong, and there was privelege for many in this that was not explicit in the law. Civil Liberties 2 - Again, law called for freedom of speech and general human rights. This was absolutely a better state than was experienced in the USSR, but not perfect, as the country was still on the road to democratizaiton. Civil Liberties 3- There is absolutely no judiciary system in place until the 1996 constitution. Civil Liberties 4 - In this pre-constitution time, legal balances of power are extremely convoluted. Civil Liberties 5 - I rated this as 1, because it is hard to find legal backing (lack of constitution) but there was certainly an intent to uphold this by many groups. Types of corruption- the ones I ticked are mostly attributed to the lack of constitution and the carryover of power from Soviet times. Overall - Hard to collect great data on this because of the lack of constituion, but there is such a huge shift towards democratizaiton. Not a very corrupt state, but not the backbones for a stable democracy. Very interesting period of time for Ukraine!",2,3,3,2,2,2,2,0,0,1,4,2,12,5,17
"Central African Republic",2003,2013,"""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","The second country I'm looking at is the Central African Republic from 2003 until 2013 under the regime of Francois Bozizé. In 2003 the Government of Ange-Felix Patassé was overthrown by armed forces under the lead of General Bozizé in a coup. After that he ruled the country of the Central African Republic until he was overthrown by the Seleka after the Crisis of the Central African Republic started in 2012 and he had to flee the country in 2013. Before I will start to analyse the political and social situation within the CAR it is very important to emphasize the regional and across-stateboarders conflict in this part of Africa. We have to keep in mind that there is a long history of a conflict between ethnic and religious groups which had an impact not only on everyday life -but also on the type of ruling (Giroux, Lanz, & Sguaitamatti, 2009) . The political system created by Mr Bozizé is described by the Economist Intelligence Unit N.A. as an 'authoritarian regimes' (Incorporated, 2008) and puts the CAR together with its neighbour states Cameroon, Chad, Congo (Brazzaville), the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan. It also notes that the Bozizé regime, which is formed by the Convergence nationale Kwa Kwa Kwa and the Parti democratique centralafricain, had a lot of support within the south of the CAR (especially in the capital Bangui) but its influence did not reach the north of the country. Also the regime had no majority in the National Assembly and opposition politicians could act mostly free and without any fear of being threatened. But the opposition the regime had to face was not as effective to challenge Mr Bozizé as it could have. The MLPC and RDC were unable to join forces and remained a divided opposition. The Freedom House ranked the authoritarian regime of Francois Bozizé at its beginnings as 'Not Free' (House, 2004) . But the country under Bozizé's rule (according to the Freedom House Index) developed from a not free state into a partly free state after 2005 and kept this status until Mr. Bozizé was ousted in 2013. In the Freedom House report of 2006 the people of the CAR were even considered to be able to change the government democratically. But then in their report of 2009 they ranked the Central African Republic as a non -electoral democracy (again) . After the coup Francois Bozizé suspended elections and shut down the National Assembly at first, but then renewed it in his favour. But the process of elections e. g. in 2005 was somehow considered to be democratic in the sense that there was no major fraud. According to Freedom House 'An independent electoral commission was created to oversee elections in 2005' (House, 2004) . In fact, as an article of website African Online News notes, the problem was the small number of participants -not any kind of unfair procedures (AfrolNews) . The elections were seen as free and fair. Furthermore: The judiciary under Bozizé supposed to be independent and free but 'in practice the judiciary is heavily under the influence of the ruling elite' (Incorporated, 2008) . In addition the regime allowed and guaranteed certain civil liberties, such as the right to speak freely, to assemble and to live your religion. But as years passed by the tensions between religious and ethnic groups grew and the freedom of religion started to be restricted. Plus women, especially in rural areas, were repressed and did not have much constitutional protection in practice. The media and press has got the right to operate without any kind of concern or fear but in reality many journalists were doing self-censorship. In addition to that, the Minority Rights Group International ranked the Central African Republic in 2008 as a country with the same status as Iran and Lebanon where ethnic minorities such as the Kaba, the Mboum, the Mbororo or the Aka were under threat. And the rule of law was not considered to be insured by the government. All in all the political system in the Central African Republic under Bozizé was instable but the conflict within society did not break out. Violence between ethnic and religious groups was not a part of everyday life (not like in the past of the CAR and in its future) but there was a great lack of democratic skills and corruption was a big problem in this time in this very poor country.

"Guatemala",2010,2015,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials""","Guatemala has a long history of dictatorship, foreign intervention, military intervention and guerrilla insurgencies. After a long civil war the country was in disarray and many individuals were being charged with corruption and human rights violations. Guatemala is known as one of most violent countries in Latin America with problems stemming from drugs and corruption. In 2011 the presidential election was won by Otto Peréz Molina of the the Patriotic Party by 54% of the vote over Manuel Baldizón of the Renewed Democratic Liberty party. This was considered to be a free and fair election although there were 36 confirmed deaths surrounding candidates, party activists and relatives making it a bloody election. While the Vice President has been linked to scandals and suspicion of her purchasing multi million dollar homes the formed president has been indicted in the U.S. for embezzling and laundering money from while he served in office. While it's written in the constitution that there is freedom of speech journalists receive threats constantly. In mid October of 2013 there had been 80 threats and attacks on journalists reported. The judiciary is also troubled by corruption, inefficiency, and the intimidation of judges and prosecutors. Witnesses and judicial-sector workers continue to be threatened and, in some cases, murdered. There was a decrease in impunity rates down from 93% to 70% in 2013.There is a deep mistrust in not only government but also police. Police continue to be accused of torture, extortion, kidnapping, extrajudicial killings, and drug-related crimes. In November of 2013 there had been 15000 complaints against police. In Freedom Houses report Guatemalas freedom rating decreased from a 4 to 3.5 percent between 2010-2015. Civil liberties stayed constant while political rights deceased from 4 to 3 showing an improvement in the system. in a Freedom House report on press it reported starting at a 60 out of 100 from 2010-2015. Transparency International reported Guatemala as the 91st most corrupt country in 2010, moving to 120th in 2011, 113th in 2012, 123rd in 2013 and 115th in 2015 citing a lack of judicial independence, lack of rule of law and voice and accountability.",2,3,3,3,2,1,2,1,2,1,4,0,13,7,20

"Viet Nam",1999,2014,"""Bribe-taking by public officials"",""Special privileges granted to politically-connected people"",""Misuse of public resources by top officials"",""Fraud committed by private citizens against the government"",""Condoning illegal business dealings""","19. 1999 is one year before trade normalization between Vietnam and the United States. The United States has since become one of Vietnam's most important trading partners. The influx of easy wealth into the country with no doubt has had a great impact on Vietnamese politics. At this time, the current Prime Minister was spending his formulative years on forging connections as the Governor of the State Bank. It would take a few short years until he assumed office upon his predecessor's nomination in 2006, an aberration in Vietnamese politics, as the Prime Minister had often been nominated by the President, after having held Standing Deputy Prime Minister position. His story of political ascendance is rumored with intrigues. 2000 was also the start of a messy period for Vietnamese politics, with a major corruption scandal surfacing in 2006, hinting at infighting and scramble for economic wealth. When Nguyen Tan Dung emerged as an unexpected interloper in that year, he overtook half of the Vietnamese economy through appointing loyal directors of state own enterprises, which have grown giant due to economic boon. He has become the most powerful Prime Minister in Vietnamese history, one whose power easily rivals that of the Party Secretary General. It is interesting to see how Vietnamese politics has also transformed on all levels with this Vietnamese game of thrones. 20. 2014 is almost now. 21. Elections are held in the country, but only for representatives in the National Assembly. But they are meaningless as candidates are fielded from local Party loyalists - active local members of Party and its Patriotic Front - and approved by local Party secretaries. Important positions such as President, Prime Minister, Central Committee and Politburo members are officially elected by National Assembly but de facto appointed by top personages upon consensus. 22. Vietnam does not grant voting right to those under 18, mentally ill, or incarcerated. And it prefers to keep the population away from mass mobilization. But the government fosters participation in peaceful guise to a rudimentary degree, and especially favors early assimilation of youths into Party organizations and culture. Interestingly, the state holds prerogative to apply compulsory treatment for 'social diseases', as in Article 61 of the Vietnamese Constitution of 1992. 23. Vietnam does not have a political alternative capable of wrestling power from the Communist Party. Though, there are troublesome signs around and within the Party. Several dozens of former government officials and intellectuals have carved out a precarious niche to softly criticize government policies. Their safety rests equally upon their past Party affiliation as their politically neutral and ostensibly preservative stance. When state politics opens its door, it starts first at the gates of the National Assembly. I expect, and have observed, that as Vietnam continues economic liberalization, politically liberal attitude cannot be helped from seeping into the great hall of the people. About 10 percent of seats in the National Assembly are to be filled by independent, unaffiliated occupants now. A small number to effect any significant changes under heavy monitoring, yet a small chance to introduce new, more tolerant discourses to national politics. Aside them, there are already a handful of Party members discontent by the current socio-economic situation. Still, as long as many of them likely depend on the Party for preservation of wealth and status, there is less reason to expect that their opinions are oppositional rather than remedial. Outside government circle, there are others whom the regime does not take so kindly. Dozens of intellectuals and minority leaders sharply challenge the government on basis of its being, drawing strength from every injustice it commits, fanning an air of defiance characteristic of Vietnamese which has covered the entire country. I suspect Eastern European regimes have collapsed for less. Yet, it is remarkable how the Communist Party shows no sign of being about to topple over. The people are dissatisfied, often angry. But Vietnamese are also known for their endurance. What is 100 years of communist rule compared to 1000 years of Chinese domination? Nevertheless, the Vietnam case warrants more attention. 24. Most Vietnamese do not have access to political power. Those wielding it inherit from their predecessors or buy it with personal connections and wealth. Merit warrant wariness more often than it does favor. Vietnamese ethnic makeup to a large degree is homogeneous. Loyalty to the Party is of utmost importance and has helped some from ethnic minorities ascend the ladder of power. However, the Hmongs, Montagnards, Chinese, Khmer, and Christians are implicitly barred from politics. Through public education, these groups' identities are systematically linked with national sufferings under imperial rule. Their 'ancestors' have been mentioned so often alongside the words 'foreign, invasion, treason, fanatic, exploitation, imperial servant dog, oppressor, etc.' that they now inherit the painful and debilitating stigma of racial and religious discrimination in Vietnam. There are 55 ethnicities in Vietnam; all of them have developed cultures and languages on par with the Maori of New Zealand. Yet, for thousands of years, the Kinh majority have enjoyed power over the hill tribes and view them as savage frontier subjects of the Vietnamese empire. There is only one name for the Vietnamese country, and it is Kinh's. This perception lingers on till this day. The Kinhs migrate to the highlands in a subtle manner of a cultural conqueror, believing they will bring modernization and progress they have learnt from the wider world to these remote parts, not knowing they will end up strangling these native cultures with their ethnocentric mindset and standards. I don't mean to speak badly about my people. They are generous and forgiving. But as eagerly as they gift honey, they gift poison, and as quickly as they forget their own pains, they forget others' pains. The injustices done to some ethnic minorities need to be addressed. Their marginalization needs to be acknowledged. Most Vietnamese would not admit, but if a poll is taken on how well the public would receive a Hmong, Chinese, Khmer, or Christian leader, none would shed an ounce of confidence in such leader's ability or trustworthiness. We need to forgive them and ask them to forgive us. Only then, the national project could withstand the true invaders to come. Sorry about the rant. :P 25. The rapid penetration of information technology and the lawless frontier characteristic of cyber space have been tipping the scale minorly in opposition's favor. However, computers have not been as effective as television in reaching rural areas beyond the cities, where most of Vietnam population live in material, and informational, poverty. Here, state media under firm government control and state propaganda dominate. State media more than often portrays cities as breeding and importing grounds of alien / Western socio-political decadence. As informal informational technology and private media orient Vietnamese urban population outward, state media orients them inward in a campaign of ruralization - upholding traditional Vietnamese values. On the cyber front, rather than attempting to silence all opposition on in the Internet in a costly, if not impossible, endeavor, the Vietnamese state watches closely for rising challengers and arrests them, snuffing them out before their profiles could garner widespread popular or international support. It is because of this threat that there have been shortage of people affiliating themselves with a dissident movement, therefore preventing the emergence of any well-organized credible / influential oppositional movement. 26. This regime is not constrained under the law. Legally and technically. Legally, it is the paramount leader of the country. Technically, the Party controls the National Assembly, charged with legislation, so laws are written as they suit the interests of the Party. The Party also cements its permanent and rather unconditional leadership position in constitutions. Its leaders, both national and local, are officially subject to the rule of law. However, a regime built upon corrupt co-optation has no other choice but to give their supporters some leeway in terrorizing ordinary citizens. If you breed a pack of dogs to herd your sheep, you will eventually have to keep a blind eye to some occasional biting and slaughtering if you wish to keep your predators barking. 27. Vietnamese citizens and residents are accorded with all fundamental human rights by Laotian Constitution. However, the more important of these rights are subject to regulation by lower laws: freedoms of movement and settlement, of demonstration, association, and assembly. The Vietnamese Constitution however does seem less open to interpretation and abuse than its Laotian counterpart. But in practice, government actions infringing on constitutional rights are still sanctioned by laws. Complaints and petitions still have to be lodged to Party's organs according to Party's guidelines in order to be considered not illegal. The 'violation' of a person's body, honor, and home without leave from the prosecutorial authority or the court is still allowed if sufficient reason warrants it. One astonishing difference is the Vietnamese authority make use of provisions directly from their detailed constitution in order to facilitate their cases. Reasons which have often been cited against dissidents include treason, damage to public order and stability, etc. In conclusion, freedoms are enshrined in constitution, but provisions are customized to be empty on their own. Instead of using amendment as done in the United States, constitutional conditions are stripped away and hidden in complicated legal decrees frequently changed without public consultation, aimed at increasing regime's flexibility to rule, disorientating the common folks and dissidents, discouraging their constitutional invocation, denying them shelter under the law. Law also justifies government intervention to restore order and provides pretext for sanction against opponents. For example in Vietnam, an assembly of more than 5 people technically requires permission from local authority. Such a law is not meant to be enforced. Ordinary people generally ignore it. But say if a suspicious gathering of 6 known political dissidents happens to be sniffed out by undercover police or informant, there will be enough cause in place to put them under temporary arrest, until an investigation of several months can support their innocence. However, the usual case is that their houses will be under search order, after which a number of evidences of their subversive activities are procured. They will be tried behind closed doors and will spend over half a decade at least for any of the multitude of crimes against the most serene republic, from tax evasion to treason. Some of them will not see their family often, and for some time. A small number of them may even commit 'suicide' within prison walls. 28. Vietnam's People's Supreme Court is the highest judicial organ in the country, however, not the highest judicial authority. By proletarian dictatorship, the National Assembly is repository of all power in the state, including judicial power. It delegates this power to the Supreme Court by appointing judges from within the Party's rank. 29. In practice, the Vietnamese government is answerable to the Party long before they are called to be held accountable to the public if grave circumstances ever arise. The Party by virtue of law and power answers to its own. There is no separation of power, no independent checks and balances. Power flows from the Party and is coordinated by the Party. Corruption investigation authority is available, but is staffed but the Central Committee of the Party, and answers to Party alone. After all, Party power comes from being the head of Human Resources, and knowledge impacting seat allotment is very much a Human Resources business. Parliamentary proceedings are open to public scrutiny. But meetings that truly matter, the Party Congresses in every five years, when all pillars of the country gather under one roof and decide the fate of the realm, are conducted behind closed doors. As are all other Party conferences. 30. Equal treatment to all ethnicities is recognized under the Constitution. But beyond that, there is no measure to protect any particular minority. Vietnam puts high priority on peace among its ethnic minorities. There are programs to assist most ethnic minorities, but they are often insufficient or mismatched vvith local immediate needs.And as mentioned, the government oppresses oppositional minorities such as the Hmongs and Montagnards. However, good news is such desired measure is now under construction. Hopefully, Vietnam will be 55 colors soon. 31. :) I do not need to justify myself on this. 32. & 33. A good friend from Sweden once told me: 'Corruption is your national culture.' I resented that opinion. Not any more. Perhaps you would better like a personal example. My father had his knee cut open in an accident not long ago. As I arrived at the hospital, I sincerely implored a doctor and a security guard at the gate to help transfer my father to the emergency room. Neither budged. I rushed my father in on my own. My father's leg was bleeding so much, the blood soaked a corner of the mattress right under him. I have been strong and composed in the face of challenges, too this one. But then I cried. And in that eternity, I saw doctors, nurses passing by with such serene grace; the air was calm as if it was in a slow-motion movie, before a bomb blows up, or a gunning occurs. Yes, if I could, I had for a moment thought I would gun those beasts to the ground. It was so surreal how in a room of 50, no eyes met yours. My father's leg was seen to eventually. It would take another 6 hours before it was stitched. I was waiting for him at the back of the emergency room; poor souls like me hurriedly passed along the deathly corridors, begging for favor and mercy, but none would be given without the consent of our beloved Uncle Ho, smiling gently on 500'000 dong notes, oblivious to the broken hands having born his grace.",0,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,6,2,8
